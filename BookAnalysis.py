       "'[ Alice \\' s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll 1865 ] CHAPTER I . Down the Rabbit - Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank , and of having nothing to do : once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading , but it had no pictures or conversations in it , \\' and what is the use of a book ,\\' thought Alice \\' without pictures or conversation ?\\' So she was considering in her own mind ( as well as she could , for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid ), whether the pleasure of making a daisy - chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies , when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her . There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that ; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself , \\' Oh dear ! Oh dear ! I shall be late !\\' ( when she thought it over afterwards , it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this , but at the time it all seemed quite natural ); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT - POCKET , and looked at it , and then hurried on , Alice started to her feet , for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat - pocket , or a watch to take out of it , and burning with curiosity , she ran across the field after it , and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit - hole under the hedge . In another moment down went Alice after it , never once considering how in the world she was to get out again . The rabbit - hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way , and then dipped suddenly down , so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well . Either the well was very deep , or she fell very slowly , for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next . First , she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to , but it was too dark to see anything ; then she looked at the sides of the well , and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book - shelves ; here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs . She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed ; it was labelled \\' ORANGE MARMALADE \\', but to her great disappointment it was empty : she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody , so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it . \\' Well !\\' thought Alice to herself , \\' after such a fall as this , I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs ! How brave they \\' ll all think me at home ! Why , I wouldn \\' t say anything about it , even if I fell off the top of the house !\\' ( Which was very likely true .) Down , down , down . Would the fall NEVER come to an end ! \\' I wonder how many miles I \\' ve fallen by this time ?\\' she said aloud . \\' I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth . Let me see : that would be four thousand miles down , I think --\\' ( for , you see , Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom , and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her knowledge , as there was no one to listen to her , still it was good practice to say it over ) \\'-- yes , that \\' s about the right distance -- but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I \\' ve got to ?\\' ( Alice had no idea what Latitude was , or Longitude either , but thought they were nice grand words to say .) Presently she began again . \\' I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth ! How funny it \\' ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward ! The Antipathies , I think --\\' ( she was rather glad there WAS no one listening , this time , as it didn \\' t sound at all the right word ) \\'-- but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is , you know . Please , Ma \\' am , is this New Zealand or Australia ?\\' ( and she tried to curtsey as she spoke -- fancy CURTSEYING as you \\' re falling through the air ! Do you think you could manage it ?) \\' And what an ignorant little girl she \\' ll think me for asking ! No , it \\' ll never do to ask : perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere .\\' Down , down , down . There was nothing else to do , so Alice soon began talking again . \\' Dinah \\' ll miss me very much to - night , I should think !\\' ( Dinah was the cat .) \\' I hope they \\' ll remember her saucer of milk at tea - time . Dinah my dear ! I wish you were down here with me ! There are no mice in the air , I \\' m afraid , but you might catch a bat , and that \\' s very like a mouse , you know . But do cats eat bats , I wonder ?\\' And here Alice began to get rather sleepy , and went on saying to herself , in a dreamy sort of way , \\' Do cats eat bats ? Do cats eat bats ?\\' and sometimes , \\' Do bats eat cats ?\\' for , you see , as she couldn \\' t answer either question , it didn \\' t much matter which way she put it . She felt that she was dozing off , and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with Dinah , and saying to her very earnestly , \\' Now , Dinah , tell me the truth : did you ever eat a bat ?\\' when suddenly , thump ! thump ! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves , and the fall was over . Alice was not a bit hurt , and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment : she looked up , but it was all dark overhead ; before her was another long passage , and the White Rabbit was still in sight , hurrying down it . There was not a moment to be lost : away went Alice like the wind , and was just in time to hear it say , as it turned a corner , \\' Oh my ears and whiskers , how late it \\' s getting !\\' She was close behind it when she turned the corner , but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen : she found herself in a long , low hall , which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof . There were doors all round the hall , but they were all locked ; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other , trying every door , she walked sadly down the middle , wondering how she was ever to get out again . Suddenly she came upon a little three - legged table , all made of solid glass ; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key , and Alice \\' s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall ; but , alas ! either the locks were too large , or the key was too small , but at any rate it would not open any of them . However , on the second time round , she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before , and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high : she tried the little golden key in the lock , and to her great delight it fitted ! Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage , not much larger than a rat - hole : she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw . How she longed to get out of that dark hall , and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains , but she could not even get her head through the doorway ; \\' and even if my head would go through ,\\' thought poor Alice , \\' it would be of very little use without my shoulders . Oh , how I wish I could shut up like a telescope ! I think I could , if I only know how to begin .\\' For , you see , so many out - of - the - way things had happened lately , that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible . There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door , so she went back to the table , half hoping she might find another key on it , or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes : this time she found a little bottle on it , (\\' which certainly was not here before ,\\' said Alice ,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label , with the words \\' DRINK ME \\' beautifully printed on it in large letters . It was all very well to say \\' Drink me ,\\' but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry . \\' No , I \\' ll look first ,\\' she said , \\' and see whether it \\' s marked \" poison \" or not \\'; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt , and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things , all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them : such as , that a red - hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long ; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife , it usually bleeds ; and she had never forgotten that , if you drink much from a bottle marked \\' poison ,\\' it is almost certain to disagree with you , sooner or later . However , this bottle was NOT marked \\' poison ,\\' so Alice ventured to taste it , and finding it very nice , ( it had , in fact , a sort of mixed flavour of cherry - tart , custard , pine - apple , roast turkey , toffee , and hot buttered toast ,) she very soon finished it off . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \\' What a curious feeling !\\' said Alice ; \\' I must be shutting up like a telescope .\\' And so it was indeed : she was now only ten inches high , and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden . First , however , she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further : she felt a little nervous about this ; \\' for it might end , you know ,\\' said Alice to herself , \\' in my going out altogether , like a candle . I wonder what I should be like then ?\\' And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out , for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing . After a while , finding that nothing more happened , she decided on going into the garden at once ; but , alas for poor Alice ! when she got to the door , she found she had forgotten the little golden key , and when she went back to the table for it , she found she could not possibly reach it : she could see it quite plainly through the glass , and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table , but it was too slippery ; and when she had tired herself out with trying , the poor little thing sat down and cried . \\' Come , there \\' s no use in crying like that !\\' said Alice to herself , rather sharply ; \\' I advise you to leave off this minute !\\' She generally gave herself very good advice , ( though she very seldom followed it ), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes ; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself , for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people . \\' But it \\' s no use now ,\\' thought poor Alice , \\' to pretend to be two people ! Why , there \\' s hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person !\\' Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table : she opened it , and found in it a very small cake , on which the words \\' EAT ME \\' were beautifully marked in currants . \\' Well , I \\' ll eat it ,\\' said Alice , \\' and if it makes me grow larger , I can reach the key ; and if it makes me grow smaller , I can creep under the door ; so either way I \\' ll get into the garden , and I don \\' t care which happens !\\' She ate a little bit , and said anxiously to herself , \\' Which way ? Which way ?\\', holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing , and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size : to be sure , this generally happens when one eats cake , but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out - of - the - way things to happen , that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way . So she set to work , and very soon finished off the cake . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II . The Pool of Tears \\' Curiouser and curiouser !\\' cried Alice ( she was so much surprised , that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good English ); \\' now I \\' m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was ! Good - bye , feet !\\' ( for when she looked down at her feet , they seemed to be almost out of sight , they were getting so far off ). \\' Oh , my poor little feet , I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now , dears ? I \\' m sure _I_ shan \\' t be able ! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you : you must manage the best way you can ;-- but I must be kind to them ,\\' thought Alice , \\' or perhaps they won \\' t walk the way I want to go ! Let me see : I \\' ll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas .\\' And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it . \\' They must go by the carrier ,\\' she thought ; \\' and how funny it \\' ll seem , sending presents to one \\' s own feet ! And how odd the directions will look ! ALICE \\' S RIGHT FOOT , ESQ . HEARTHRUG , NEAR THE FENDER , ( WITH ALICE \\' S LOVE ). Oh dear , what nonsense I \\' m talking !\\' Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall : in fact she was now more than nine feet high , and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door . Poor Alice ! It was as much as she could do , lying down on one side , to look through into the garden with one eye ; but to get through was more hopeless than ever : she sat down and began to cry again . \\' You ought to be ashamed of yourself ,\\' said Alice , \\' a great girl like you ,\\' ( she might well say this ), \\' to go on crying in this way ! Stop this moment , I tell you !\\' But she went on all the same , shedding gallons of tears , until there was a large pool all round her , about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall . After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance , and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming . It was the White Rabbit returning , splendidly dressed , with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other : he came trotting along in a great hurry , muttering to himself as he came , \\' Oh ! the Duchess , the Duchess ! Oh ! won \\' t she be savage if I \\' ve kept her waiting !\\' Alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one ; so , when the Rabbit came near her , she began , in a low , timid voice , \\' If you please , sir --\\' The Rabbit started violently , dropped the white kid gloves and the fan , and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go . Alice took up the fan and gloves , and , as the hall was very hot , she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking : \\' Dear , dear ! How queer everything is to - day ! And yesterday things went on just as usual . I wonder if I \\' ve been changed in the night ? Let me think : was I the same when I got up this morning ? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different . But if I \\' m not the same , the next question is , Who in the world am I ? Ah , THAT \\' S the great puzzle !\\' And she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself , to see if she could have been changed for any of them . \\' I \\' m sure I \\' m not Ada ,\\' she said , \\' for her hair goes in such long ringlets , and mine doesn \\' t go in ringlets at all ; and I \\' m sure I can \\' t be Mabel , for I know all sorts of things , and she , oh ! she knows such a very little ! Besides , SHE \\' S she , and I \\' m I , and -- oh dear , how puzzling it all is ! I \\' ll try if I know all the things I used to know . Let me see : four times five is twelve , and four times six is thirteen , and four times seven is -- oh dear ! I shall never get to twenty at that rate ! However , the Multiplication Table doesn \\' t signify : let \\' s try Geography . London is the capital of Paris , and Paris is the capital of Rome , and Rome -- no , THAT \\' S all wrong , I \\' m certain ! I must have been changed for Mabel ! I \\' ll try and say \" How doth the little --\"\\' and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons , and began to repeat it , but her voice sounded hoarse and strange , and the words did not come the same as they used to do :-- \\' How doth the little crocodile Improve his shining tail , And pour the waters of the Nile On every golden scale ! \\' How cheerfully he seems to grin , How neatly spread his claws , And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws !\\' \\' I \\' m sure those are not the right words ,\\' said poor Alice , and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on , \\' I must be Mabel after all , and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house , and have next to no toys to play with , and oh ! ever so many lessons to learn ! No , I \\' ve made up my mind about it ; if I \\' m Mabel , I \\' ll stay down here ! It \\' ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying \" Come up again , dear !\" I shall only look up and say \" Who am I then ? Tell me that first , and then , if I like being that person , I \\' ll come up : if not , I \\' ll stay down here till I \\' m somebody else \"-- but , oh dear !\\' cried Alice , with a sudden burst of tears , \\' I do wish they WOULD put their heads down ! I am so VERY tired of being all alone here !\\' As she said this she looked down at her hands , and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit \\' s little white kid gloves while she was talking . \\' How CAN I have done that ?\\' she thought . \\' I must be growing small again .\\' She got up and went to the table to measure herself by it , and found that , as nearly as she could guess , she was now about two feet high , and was going on shrinking rapidly : she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding , and she dropped it hastily , just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether . \\' That WAS a narrow escape !\\' said Alice , a good deal frightened at the sudden change , but very glad to find herself still in existence ; \\' and now for the garden !\\' and she ran with all speed back to the little door : but , alas ! the little door was shut again , and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before , \\' and things are worse than ever ,\\' thought the poor child , \\' for I never was so small as this before , never ! And I declare it \\' s too bad , that it is !\\' As she said these words her foot slipped , and in another moment , splash ! she was up to her chin in salt water . Her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea , \\' and in that case I can go back by railway ,\\' she said to herself . ( Alice had been to the seaside once in her life , and had come to the general conclusion , that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea , some children digging in the sand with wooden spades , then a row of lodging houses , and behind them a railway station .) However , she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high . \\' I wish I hadn \\' t cried so much !\\' said Alice , as she swam about , trying to find her way out . \\' I shall be punished for it now , I suppose , by being drowned in my own tears ! That WILL be a queer thing , to be sure ! However , everything is queer to - day .\\' Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off , and she swam nearer to make out what it was : at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus , but then she remembered how small she was now , and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself . \\' Would it be of any use , now ,\\' thought Alice , \\' to speak to this mouse ? Everything is so out - of - the - way down here , that I should think very likely it can talk : at any rate , there \\' s no harm in trying .\\' So she began : \\' O Mouse , do you know the way out of this pool ? I am very tired of swimming about here , O Mouse !\\' ( Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse : she had never done such a thing before , but she remembered having seen in her brother \\' s Latin Grammar , \\' A mouse -- of a mouse -- to a mouse -- a mouse -- O mouse !\\') The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively , and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes , but it said nothing . \\' Perhaps it doesn \\' t understand English ,\\' thought Alice ; \\' I daresay it \\' s a French mouse , come over with William the Conqueror .\\' ( For , with all her knowledge of history , Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened .) So she began again : \\' Ou est ma chatte ?\\' which was the first sentence in her French lesson - book . The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water , and seemed to quiver all over with fright . \\' Oh , I beg your pardon !\\' cried Alice hastily , afraid that she had hurt the poor animal \\' s feelings . \\' I quite forgot you didn \\' t like cats .\\' \\' Not like cats !\\' cried the Mouse , in a shrill , passionate voice . \\' Would YOU like cats if you were me ?\\' \\' Well , perhaps not ,\\' said Alice in a soothing tone : \\' don \\' t be angry about it . And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you \\' d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her . She is such a dear quiet thing ,\\' Alice went on , half to herself , as she swam lazily about in the pool , \\' and she sits purring so nicely by the fire , licking her paws and washing her face -- and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse -- and she \\' s such a capital one for catching mice -- oh , I beg your pardon !\\' cried Alice again , for this time the Mouse was bristling all over , and she felt certain it must be really offended . \\' We won \\' t talk about her any more if you \\' d rather not .\\' \\' We indeed !\\' cried the Mouse , who was trembling down to the end of his tail . \\' As if I would talk on such a subject ! Our family always HATED cats : nasty , low , vulgar things ! Don \\' t let me hear the name again !\\' \\' I won \\' t indeed !\\' said Alice , in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation . \\' Are you -- are you fond -- of -- of dogs ?\\' The Mouse did not answer , so Alice went on eagerly : \\' There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you ! A little bright - eyed terrier , you know , with oh , such long curly brown hair ! And it \\' ll fetch things when you throw them , and it \\' ll sit up and beg for its dinner , and all sorts of things -- I can \\' t remember half of them -- and it belongs to a farmer , you know , and he says it \\' s so useful , it \\' s worth a hundred pounds ! He says it kills all the rats and -- oh dear !\\' cried Alice in a sorrowful tone , \\' I \\' m afraid I \\' ve offended it again !\\' For the Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go , and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went . So she called softly after it , \\' Mouse dear ! Do come back again , and we won \\' t talk about cats or dogs either , if you don \\' t like them !\\' When the Mouse heard this , it turned round and swam slowly back to her : its face was quite pale ( with passion , Alice thought ), and it said in a low trembling voice , \\' Let us get to the shore , and then I \\' ll tell you my history , and you \\' ll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs .\\' It was high time to go , for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it : there were a Duck and a Dodo , a Lory and an Eaglet , and several other curious creatures . Alice led the way , and the whole party swam to the shore . CHAPTER III . A Caucus - Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer - looking party that assembled on the bank -- the birds with draggled feathers , the animals with their fur clinging close to them , and all dripping wet , cross , and uncomfortable . The first question of course was , how to get dry again : they had a consultation about this , and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them , as if she had known them all her life . Indeed , she had quite a long argument with the Lory , who at last turned sulky , and would only say , \\' I am older than you , and must know better \\'; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was , and , as the Lory positively refused to tell its age , there was no more to be said . At last the Mouse , who seemed to be a person of authority among them , called out , \\' Sit down , all of you , and listen to me ! I \\' LL soon make you dry enough !\\' They all sat down at once , in a large ring , with the Mouse in the middle . Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it , for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon . \\' Ahem !\\' said the Mouse with an important air , \\' are you all ready ? This is the driest thing I know . Silence all round , if you please ! \" William the Conqueror , whose cause was favoured by the pope , was soon submitted to by the English , who wanted leaders , and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest . Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria --\"\\' \\' Ugh !\\' said the Lory , with a shiver . \\' I beg your pardon !\\' said the Mouse , frowning , but very politely : \\' Did you speak ?\\' \\' Not I !\\' said the Lory hastily . \\' I thought you did ,\\' said the Mouse . \\'-- I proceed . \" Edwin and Morcar , the earls of Mercia and Northumbria , declared for him : and even Stigand , the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury , found it advisable --\"\\' \\' Found WHAT ?\\' said the Duck . \\' Found IT ,\\' the Mouse replied rather crossly : \\' of course you know what \" it \" means .\\' \\' I know what \" it \" means well enough , when I find a thing ,\\' said the Duck : \\' it \\' s generally a frog or a worm . The question is , what did the archbishop find ?\\' The Mouse did not notice this question , but hurriedly went on , \\'\"-- found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him the crown . William \\' s conduct at first was moderate . But the insolence of his Normans --\" How are you getting on now , my dear ?\\' it continued , turning to Alice as it spoke . \\' As wet as ever ,\\' said Alice in a melancholy tone : \\' it doesn \\' t seem to dry me at all .\\' \\' In that case ,\\' said the Dodo solemnly , rising to its feet , \\' I move that the meeting adjourn , for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies --\\' \\' Speak English !\\' said the Eaglet . \\' I don \\' t know the meaning of half those long words , and , what \\' s more , I don \\' t believe you do either !\\' And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile : some of the other birds tittered audibly . \\' What I was going to say ,\\' said the Dodo in an offended tone , \\' was , that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus - race .\\' \\' What IS a Caucus - race ?\\' said Alice ; not that she wanted much to know , but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak , and no one else seemed inclined to say anything . \\' Why ,\\' said the Dodo , \\' the best way to explain it is to do it .\\' ( And , as you might like to try the thing yourself , some winter day , I will tell you how the Dodo managed it .) First it marked out a race - course , in a sort of circle , (\\' the exact shape doesn \\' t matter ,\\' it said ,) and then all the party were placed along the course , here and there . There was no \\' One , two , three , and away ,\\' but they began running when they liked , and left off when they liked , so that it was not easy to know when the race was over . However , when they had been running half an hour or so , and were quite dry again , the Dodo suddenly called out \\' The race is over !\\' and they all crowded round it , panting , and asking , \\' But who has won ?\\' This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought , and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead ( the position in which you usually see Shakespeare , in the pictures of him ), while the rest waited in silence . At last the Dodo said , \\' EVERYBODY has won , and all must have prizes .\\' \\' But who is to give the prizes ?\\' quite a chorus of voices asked . \\' Why , SHE , of course ,\\' said the Dodo , pointing to Alice with one finger ; and the whole party at once crowded round her , calling out in a confused way , \\' Prizes ! Prizes !\\' Alice had no idea what to do , and in despair she put her hand in her pocket , and pulled out a box of comfits , ( luckily the salt water had not got into it ), and handed them round as prizes . There was exactly one a - piece all round . \\' But she must have a prize herself , you know ,\\' said the Mouse . \\' Of course ,\\' the Dodo replied very gravely . \\' What else have you got in your pocket ?\\' he went on , turning to Alice . \\' Only a thimble ,\\' said Alice sadly . \\' Hand it over here ,\\' said the Dodo . Then they all crowded round her once more , while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble , saying \\' We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble \\'; and , when it had finished this short speech , they all cheered . Alice thought the whole thing very absurd , but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh ; and , as she could not think of anything to say , she simply bowed , and took the thimble , looking as solemn as she could . The next thing was to eat the comfits : this caused some noise and confusion , as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs , and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back . However , it was over at last , and they sat down again in a ring , and begged the Mouse to tell them something more . \\' You promised to tell me your history , you know ,\\' said Alice , \\' and why it is you hate -- C and D ,\\' she added in a whisper , half afraid that it would be offended again . \\' Mine is a long and a sad tale !\\' said the Mouse , turning to Alice , and sighing . \\' It IS a long tail , certainly ,\\' said Alice , looking down with wonder at the Mouse \\' s tail ; \\' but why do you call it sad ?\\' And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking , so that her idea of the tale was something like this :-- \\' Fury said to a mouse , That he met in the house , \" Let us both go to law : I will prosecute YOU .-- Come , I \\' ll take no denial ; We must have a trial : For really this morning I \\' ve nothing to do .\" Said the mouse to the cur , \" Such a trial , dear Sir , With no jury or judge , would be wasting our breath .\" \" I \\' ll be judge , I \\' ll be jury ,\" Said cunning old Fury : \" I \\' ll try the whole cause , and condemn you to death .\"\\' \\' You are not attending !\\' said the Mouse to Alice severely . \\' What are you thinking of ?\\' \\' I beg your pardon ,\\' said Alice very humbly : \\' you had got to the fifth bend , I think ?\\' \\' I had NOT !\\' cried the Mouse , sharply and very angrily . \\' A knot !\\' said Alice , always ready to make herself useful , and looking anxiously about her . \\' Oh , do let me help to undo it !\\' \\' I shall do nothing of the sort ,\\' said the Mouse , getting up and walking away . \\' You insult me by talking such nonsense !\\' \\' I didn \\' t mean it !\\' pleaded poor Alice . \\' But you \\' re so easily offended , you know !\\' The Mouse only growled in reply . \\' Please come back and finish your story !\\' Alice called after it ; and the others all joined in chorus , \\' Yes , please do !\\' but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently , and walked a little quicker . \\' What a pity it wouldn \\' t stay !\\' sighed the Lory , as soon as it was quite out of sight ; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter \\' Ah , my dear ! Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper !\\' \\' Hold your tongue , Ma !\\' said the young Crab , a little snappishly . \\' You \\' re enough to try the patience of an oyster !\\' \\' I wish I had our Dinah here , I know I do !\\' said Alice aloud , addressing nobody in particular . \\' She \\' d soon fetch it back !\\' \\' And who is Dinah , if I might venture to ask the question ?\\' said the Lory . Alice replied eagerly , for she was always ready to talk about her pet : \\' Dinah \\' s our cat . And she \\' s such a capital one for catching mice you can \\' t think ! And oh , I wish you could see her after the birds ! Why , she \\' ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it !\\' This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party . Some of the birds hurried off at once : one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully , remarking , \\' I really must be getting home ; the night - air doesn \\' t suit my throat !\\' and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children , \\' Come away , my dears ! It \\' s high time you were all in bed !\\' On various pretexts they all moved off , and Alice was soon left alone . \\' I wish I hadn \\' t mentioned Dinah !\\' she said to herself in a melancholy tone . \\' Nobody seems to like her , down here , and I \\' m sure she \\' s the best cat in the world ! Oh , my dear Dinah ! I wonder if I shall ever see you any more !\\' And here poor Alice began to cry again , for she felt very lonely and low - spirited . In a little while , however , she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance , and she looked up eagerly , half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind , and was coming back to finish his story . CHAPTER IV . The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill It was the White Rabbit , trotting slowly back again , and looking anxiously about as it went , as if it had lost something ; and she heard it muttering to itself \\' The Duchess ! The Duchess ! Oh my dear paws ! Oh my fur and whiskers ! She \\' ll get me executed , as sure as ferrets are ferrets ! Where CAN I have dropped them , I wonder ?\\' Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves , and she very good - naturedly began hunting about for them , but they were nowhere to be seen -- everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool , and the great hall , with the glass table and the little door , had vanished completely . Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice , as she went hunting about , and called out to her in an angry tone , \\' Why , Mary Ann , what ARE you doing out here ? Run home this moment , and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan ! Quick , now !\\' And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to , without trying to explain the mistake it had made . \\' He took me for his housemaid ,\\' she said to herself as she ran . \\' How surprised he \\' ll be when he finds out who I am ! But I \\' d better take him his fan and gloves -- that is , if I can find them .\\' As she said this , she came upon a neat little house , on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name \\' W . RABBIT \\' engraved upon it . She went in without knocking , and hurried upstairs , in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann , and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves . \\' How queer it seems ,\\' Alice said to herself , \\' to be going messages for a rabbit ! I suppose Dinah \\' ll be sending me on messages next !\\' And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen : \\'\" Miss Alice ! Come here directly , and get ready for your walk !\" \" Coming in a minute , nurse ! But I \\' ve got to see that the mouse doesn \\' t get out .\" Only I don \\' t think ,\\' Alice went on , \\' that they \\' d let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that !\\' By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window , and on it ( as she had hoped ) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves : she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves , and was just going to leave the room , when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking - glass . There was no label this time with the words \\' DRINK ME ,\\' but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips . \\' I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen ,\\' she said to herself , \\' whenever I eat or drink anything ; so I \\' ll just see what this bottle does . I do hope it \\' ll make me grow large again , for really I \\' m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing !\\' It did so indeed , and much sooner than she had expected : before she had drunk half the bottle , she found her head pressing against the ceiling , and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken . She hastily put down the bottle , saying to herself \\' That \\' s quite enough -- I hope I shan \\' t grow any more -- As it is , I can \\' t get out at the door -- I do wish I hadn \\' t drunk quite so much !\\' Alas ! it was too late to wish that ! She went on growing , and growing , and very soon had to kneel down on the floor : in another minute there was not even room for this , and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door , and the other arm curled round her head . Still she went on growing , and , as a last resource , she put one arm out of the window , and one foot up the chimney , and said to herself \\' Now I can do no more , whatever happens . What WILL become of me ?\\' Luckily for Alice , the little magic bottle had now had its full effect , and she grew no larger : still it was very uncomfortable , and , as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again , no wonder she felt unhappy . \\' It was much pleasanter at home ,\\' thought poor Alice , \\' when one wasn \\' t always growing larger and smaller , and being ordered about by mice and rabbits . I almost wish I hadn \\' t gone down that rabbit - hole -- and yet -- and yet -- it \\' s rather curious , you know , this sort of life ! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me ! When I used to read fairy - tales , I fancied that kind of thing never happened , and now here I am in the middle of one ! There ought to be a book written about me , that there ought ! And when I grow up , I \\' ll write one -- but I \\' m grown up now ,\\' she added in a sorrowful tone ; \\' at least there \\' s no room to grow up any more HERE .\\' \\' But then ,\\' thought Alice , \\' shall I NEVER get any older than I am now ? That \\' ll be a comfort , one way -- never to be an old woman -- but then -- always to have lessons to learn ! Oh , I shouldn \\' t like THAT !\\' \\' Oh , you foolish Alice !\\' she answered herself . \\' How can you learn lessons in here ? Why , there \\' s hardly room for YOU , and no room at all for any lesson - books !\\' And so she went on , taking first one side and then the other , and making quite a conversation of it altogether ; but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside , and stopped to listen . \\' Mary Ann ! Mary Ann !\\' said the voice . \\' Fetch me my gloves this moment !\\' Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs . Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her , and she trembled till she shook the house , quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit , and had no reason to be afraid of it . Presently the Rabbit came up to the door , and tried to open it ; but , as the door opened inwards , and Alice \\' s elbow was pressed hard against it , that attempt proved a failure . Alice heard it say to itself \\' Then I \\' ll go round and get in at the window .\\' \\' THAT you won \\' t \\' thought Alice , and , after waiting till she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window , she suddenly spread out her hand , and made a snatch in the air . She did not get hold of anything , but she heard a little shriek and a fall , and a crash of broken glass , from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber - frame , or something of the sort . Next came an angry voice -- the Rabbit \\' s --\\' Pat ! Pat ! Where are you ?\\' And then a voice she had never heard before , \\' Sure then I \\' m here ! Digging for apples , yer honour !\\' \\' Digging for apples , indeed !\\' said the Rabbit angrily . \\' Here ! Come and help me out of THIS !\\' ( Sounds of more broken glass .) \\' Now tell me , Pat , what \\' s that in the window ?\\' \\' Sure , it \\' s an arm , yer honour !\\' ( He pronounced it \\' arrum .\\') \\' An arm , you goose ! Who ever saw one that size ? Why , it fills the whole window !\\' \\' Sure , it does , yer honour : but it \\' s an arm for all that .\\' \\' Well , it \\' s got no business there , at any rate : go and take it away !\\' There was a long silence after this , and Alice could only hear whispers now and then ; such as , \\' Sure , I don \\' t like it , yer honour , at all , at all !\\' \\' Do as I tell you , you coward !\\' and at last she spread out her hand again , and made another snatch in the air . This time there were TWO little shrieks , and more sounds of broken glass . \\' What a number of cucumber - frames there must be !\\' thought Alice . \\' I wonder what they \\' ll do next ! As for pulling me out of the window , I only wish they COULD ! I \\' m sure I don \\' t want to stay in here any longer !\\' She waited for some time without hearing anything more : at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels , and the sound of a good many voices all talking together : she made out the words : \\' Where \\' s the other ladder ?-- Why , I hadn \\' t to bring but one ; Bill \\' s got the other -- Bill ! fetch it here , lad !-- Here , put \\' em up at this corner -- No , tie \\' em together first -- they don \\' t reach half high enough yet -- Oh ! they \\' ll do well enough ; don \\' t be particular -- Here , Bill ! catch hold of this rope -- Will the roof bear ?-- Mind that loose slate -- Oh , it \\' s coming down ! Heads below !\\' ( a loud crash )--\\' Now , who did that ?-- It was Bill , I fancy -- Who \\' s to go down the chimney ?-- Nay , I shan \\' t ! YOU do it !-- That I won \\' t , then !-- Bill \\' s to go down -- Here , Bill ! the master says you \\' re to go down the chimney !\\' \\' Oh ! So Bill \\' s got to come down the chimney , has he ?\\' said Alice to herself . \\' Shy , they seem to put everything upon Bill ! I wouldn \\' t be in Bill \\' s place for a good deal : this fireplace is narrow , to be sure ; but I THINK I can kick a little !\\' She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could , and waited till she heard a little animal ( she couldn \\' t guess of what sort it was ) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her : then , saying to herself \\' This is Bill ,\\' she gave one sharp kick , and waited to see what would happen next . The first thing she heard was a general chorus of \\' There goes Bill !\\' then the Rabbit \\' s voice along --\\' Catch him , you by the hedge !\\' then silence , and then another confusion of voices --\\' Hold up his head -- Brandy now -- Don \\' t choke him -- How was it , old fellow ? What happened to you ? Tell us all about it !\\' Last came a little feeble , squeaking voice , (\\' That \\' s Bill ,\\' thought Alice ,) \\' Well , I hardly know -- No more , thank ye ; I \\' m better now -- but I \\' m a deal too flustered to tell you -- all I know is , something comes at me like a Jack - in - the - box , and up I goes like a sky - rocket !\\' \\' So you did , old fellow !\\' said the others . \\' We must burn the house down !\\' said the Rabbit \\' s voice ; and Alice called out as loud as she could , \\' If you do . I \\' ll set Dinah at you !\\' There was a dead silence instantly , and Alice thought to herself , \\' I wonder what they WILL do next ! If they had any sense , they \\' d take the roof off .\\' After a minute or two , they began moving about again , and Alice heard the Rabbit say , \\' A barrowful will do , to begin with .\\' \\' A barrowful of WHAT ?\\' thought Alice ; but she had not long to doubt , for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window , and some of them hit her in the face . \\' I \\' ll put a stop to this ,\\' she said to herself , and shouted out , \\' You \\' d better not do that again !\\' which produced another dead silence . Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor , and a bright idea came into her head . \\' If I eat one of these cakes ,\\' she thought , \\' it \\' s sure to make SOME change in my size ; and as it can \\' t possibly make me larger , it must make me smaller , I suppose .\\' So she swallowed one of the cakes , and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly . As soon as she was small enough to get through the door , she ran out of the house , and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside . The poor little Lizard , Bill , was in the middle , being held up by two guinea - pigs , who were giving it something out of a bottle . They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared ; but she ran off as hard as she could , and soon found herself safe in a thick wood . \\' The first thing I \\' ve got to do ,\\' said Alice to herself , as she wandered about in the wood , \\' is to grow to my right size again ; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden . I think that will be the best plan .\\' It sounded an excellent plan , no doubt , and very neatly and simply arranged ; the only difficulty was , that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it ; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees , a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry . An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes , and feebly stretching out one paw , trying to touch her . \\' Poor little thing !\\' said Alice , in a coaxing tone , and she tried hard to whistle to it ; but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry , in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing . Hardly knowing what she did , she picked up a little bit of stick , and held it out to the puppy ; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once , with a yelp of delight , and rushed at the stick , and made believe to worry it ; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle , to keep herself from being run over ; and the moment she appeared on the other side , the puppy made another rush at the stick , and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it ; then Alice , thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart - horse , and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet , ran round the thistle again ; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick , running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back , and barking hoarsely all the while , till at last it sat down a good way off , panting , with its tongue hanging out of its mouth , and its great eyes half shut . This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape ; so she set off at once , and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath , and till the puppy \\' s bark sounded quite faint in the distance . \\' And yet what a dear little puppy it was !\\' said Alice , as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself , and fanned herself with one of the leaves : \\' I should have liked teaching it tricks very much , if -- if I \\' d only been the right size to do it ! Oh dear ! I \\' d nearly forgotten that I \\' ve got to grow up again ! Let me see -- how IS it to be managed ? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other ; but the great question is , what ?\\' The great question certainly was , what ? Alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass , but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances . There was a large mushroom growing near her , about the same height as herself ; and when she had looked under it , and on both sides of it , and behind it , it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it . She stretched herself up on tiptoe , and peeped over the edge of the mushroom , and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar , that was sitting on the top with its arms folded , quietly smoking a long hookah , and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else . CHAPTER V . Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence : at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth , and addressed her in a languid , sleepy voice . \\' Who are YOU ?\\' said the Caterpillar . This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation . Alice replied , rather shyly , \\' I -- I hardly know , sir , just at present -- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning , but I think I must have been changed several times since then .\\' \\' What do you mean by that ?\\' said the Caterpillar sternly . \\' Explain yourself !\\' \\' I can \\' t explain MYSELF , I \\' m afraid , sir \\' said Alice , \\' because I \\' m not myself , you see .\\' \\' I don \\' t see ,\\' said the Caterpillar . \\' I \\' m afraid I can \\' t put it more clearly ,\\' Alice replied very politely , \\' for I can \\' t understand it myself to begin with ; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing .\\' \\' It isn \\' t ,\\' said the Caterpillar . \\' Well , perhaps you haven \\' t found it so yet ,\\' said Alice ; \\' but when you have to turn into a chrysalis -- you will some day , you know -- and then after that into a butterfly , I should think you \\' ll feel it a little queer , won \\' t you ?\\' \\' Not a bit ,\\' said the Caterpillar . \\' Well , perhaps your feelings may be different ,\\' said Alice ; \\' all I know is , it would feel very queer to ME .\\' \\' You !\\' said the Caterpillar contemptuously . \\' Who are YOU ?\\' Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation . Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar \\' s making such VERY short remarks , and she drew herself up and said , very gravely , \\' I think , you ought to tell me who YOU are , first .\\' \\' Why ?\\' said the Caterpillar . Here was another puzzling question ; and as Alice could not think of any good reason , and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind , she turned away . \\' Come back !\\' the Caterpillar called after her . \\' I \\' ve something important to say !\\' This sounded promising , certainly : Alice turned and came back again . \\' Keep your temper ,\\' said the Caterpillar . \\' Is that all ?\\' said Alice , swallowing down her anger as well as she could . \\' No ,\\' said the Caterpillar . Alice thought she might as well wait , as she had nothing else to do , and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing . For some minutes it puffed away without speaking , but at last it unfolded its arms , took the hookah out of its mouth again , and said , \\' So you think you \\' re changed , do you ?\\' \\' I \\' m afraid I am , sir ,\\' said Alice ; \\' I can \\' t remember things as I used -- and I don \\' t keep the same size for ten minutes together !\\' \\' Can \\' t remember WHAT things ?\\' said the Caterpillar . \\' Well , I \\' ve tried to say \" HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE ,\" but it all came different !\\' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice . \\' Repeat , \" YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM ,\"\\' said the Caterpillar . Alice folded her hands , and began :-- \\' You are old , Father William ,\\' the young man said , \\' And your hair has become very white ; And yet you incessantly stand on your head -- Do you think , at your age , it is right ?\\' \\' In my youth ,\\' Father William replied to his son , \\' I feared it might injure the brain ; But , now that I \\' m perfectly sure I have none , Why , I do it again and again .\\' \\' You are old ,\\' said the youth , \\' as I mentioned before , And have grown most uncommonly fat ; Yet you turned a back - somersault in at the door -- Pray , what is the reason of that ?\\' \\' In my youth ,\\' said the sage , as he shook his grey locks , \\' I kept all my limbs very supple By the use of this ointment -- one shilling the box -- Allow me to sell you a couple ?\\' \\' You are old ,\\' said the youth , \\' and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet ; Yet you finished the goose , with the bones and the beak -- Pray how did you manage to do it ?\\' \\' In my youth ,\\' said his father , \\' I took to the law , And argued each case with my wife ; And the muscular strength , which it gave to my jaw , Has lasted the rest of my life .\\' \\' You are old ,\\' said the youth , \\' one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever ; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose -- What made you so awfully clever ?\\' \\' I have answered three questions , and that is enough ,\\' Said his father ; \\' don \\' t give yourself airs ! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff ? Be off , or I \\' ll kick you down stairs !\\' \\' That is not said right ,\\' said the Caterpillar . \\' Not QUITE right , I \\' m afraid ,\\' said Alice , timidly ; \\' some of the words have got altered .\\' \\' It is wrong from beginning to end ,\\' said the Caterpillar decidedly , and there was silence for some minutes . The Caterpillar was the first to speak . \\' What size do you want to be ?\\' it asked . \\' Oh , I \\' m not particular as to size ,\\' Alice hastily replied ; \\' only one doesn \\' t like changing so often , you know .\\' \\' I DON \\' T know ,\\' said the Caterpillar . Alice said nothing : she had never been so much contradicted in her life before , and she felt that she was losing her temper . \\' Are you content now ?\\' said the Caterpillar . \\' Well , I should like to be a LITTLE larger , sir , if you wouldn \\' t mind ,\\' said Alice : \\' three inches is such a wretched height to be .\\' \\' It is a very good height indeed !\\' said the Caterpillar angrily , rearing itself upright as it spoke ( it was exactly three inches high ). \\' But I \\' m not used to it !\\' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone . And she thought of herself , \\' I wish the creatures wouldn \\' t be so easily offended !\\' \\' You \\' ll get used to it in time ,\\' said the Caterpillar ; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again . This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again . In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice , and shook itself . Then it got down off the mushroom , and crawled away in the grass , merely remarking as it went , \\' One side will make you grow taller , and the other side will make you grow shorter .\\' \\' One side of WHAT ? The other side of WHAT ?\\' thought Alice to herself . \\' Of the mushroom ,\\' said the Caterpillar , just as if she had asked it aloud ; and in another moment it was out of sight . Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute , trying to make out which were the two sides of it ; and as it was perfectly round , she found this a very difficult question . However , at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go , and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand . \\' And now which is which ?\\' she said to herself , and nibbled a little of the right - hand bit to try the effect : the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin : it had struck her foot ! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change , but she felt that there was no time to be lost , as she was shrinking rapidly ; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit . Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot , that there was hardly room to open her mouth ; but she did it at last , and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit . * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * \\' Come , my head \\' s free at last !\\' said Alice in a tone of delight , which changed into alarm in another moment , when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found : all she could see , when she looked down , was an immense length of neck , which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her . \\' What CAN all that green stuff be ?\\' said Alice . \\' And where HAVE my shoulders got to ? And oh , my poor hands , how is it I can \\' t see you ?\\' She was moving them about as she spoke , but no result seemed to follow , except a little shaking among the distant green leaves . As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head , she tried to get her head down to them , and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction , like a serpent . She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag , and was going to dive in among the leaves , which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering , when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry : a large pigeon had flown into her face , and was beating her violently with its wings . \\' Serpent !\\' screamed the Pigeon . \\' I \\' m NOT a serpent !\\' said Alice indignantly . \\' Let me alone !\\' \\' Serpent , I say again !\\' repeated the Pigeon , but in a more subdued tone , and added with a kind of sob , \\' I \\' ve tried every way , and nothing seems to suit them !\\' \\' I haven \\' t the least idea what you \\' re talking about ,\\' said Alice . \\' I \\' ve tried the roots of trees , and I \\' ve tried banks , and I \\' ve tried hedges ,\\' the Pigeon went on , without attending to her ; \\' but those serpents ! There \\' s no pleasing them !\\' Alice was more and more puzzled , but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished . \\' As if it wasn \\' t trouble enough hatching the eggs ,\\' said the Pigeon ; \\' but I must be on the look - out for serpents night and day ! Why , I haven \\' t had a wink of sleep these three weeks !\\' \\' I \\' m very sorry you \\' ve been annoyed ,\\' said Alice , who was beginning to see its meaning . \\' And just as I \\' d taken the highest tree in the wood ,\\' continued the Pigeon , raising its voice to a shriek , \\' and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last , they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ! Ugh , Serpent !\\' \\' But I \\' m NOT a serpent , I tell you !\\' said Alice . \\' I \\' m a -- I \\' m a --\\' \\' Well ! WHAT are you ?\\' said the Pigeon . \\' I can see you \\' re trying to invent something !\\' \\' I -- I \\' m a little girl ,\\' said Alice , rather doubtfully , as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day . \\' A likely story indeed !\\' said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt . \\' I \\' ve seen a good many little girls in my time , but never ONE with such a neck as that ! No , no ! You \\' re a serpent ; and there \\' s no use denying it . I suppose you \\' ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg !\\' \\' I HAVE tasted eggs , certainly ,\\' said Alice , who was a very truthful child ; \\' but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do , you know .\\' \\' I don \\' t believe it ,\\' said the Pigeon ; \\' but if they do , why then they \\' re a kind of serpent , that \\' s all I can say .\\' This was such a new idea to Alice , that she was quite silent for a minute or two , which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding , \\' You \\' re looking for eggs , I know THAT well enough ; and what does it matter to me whether you \\' re a little girl or a serpent ?\\' \\' It matters a good deal to ME ,\\' said Alice hastily ; \\' but I \\' m not looking for eggs , as it happens ; and if I was , I shouldn \\' t want YOURS : I don \\' t like them raw .\\' \\' Well , be off , then !\\' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone , as it settled down again into its nest . Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could , for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches , and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it . After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands , and she set to work very carefully , nibbling first at one and then at the other , and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter , until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height . It was so long since she had been anything near the right size , that it felt quite strange at first ; but she got used to it in a few minutes , and began talking to herself , as usual . \\' Come , there \\' s half my plan done now ! How puzzling all these changes are ! I \\' m never sure what I \\' m going to be , from one minute to another ! However , I \\' ve got back to my right size : the next thing is , to get into that beautiful garden -- how IS that to be done , I wonder ?\\' As she said this , she came suddenly upon an open place , with a little house in it about four feet high . \\' Whoever lives there ,\\' thought Alice , \\' it \\' ll never do to come upon them THIS size : why , I should frighten them out of their wits !\\' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again , and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high .

Pig and Pepper For a minute or two she stood looking at the house , and wondering what to do next , when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood --( she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery : otherwise , judging by his face only , she would have called him a fish )-- and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles . It was opened by another footman in livery , with a round face , and large eyes like a frog ; and both footmen , Alice noticed , had powdered hair that curled all over their heads . She felt very curious to know what it was all about , and crept a little way out of the wood to listen . The Fish - Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter , nearly as large as himself , and this he handed over to the other , saying , in a solemn tone , \\' For the Duchess . An invitation from the Queen to play croquet .\\' The Frog - Footman repeated , in the same solemn tone , only changing the order of the words a little , \\' From the Queen . An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet .\\' Then they both bowed low , and their curls got entangled together . Alice laughed so much at this , that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her ; and when she next peeped out the Fish - Footman was gone , and the other was sitting on the ground near the door , staring stupidly up into the sky . Alice went timidly up to the door , and knocked . \\' There \\' s no sort of use in knocking ,\\' said the Footman , \\' and that for two reasons . First , because I \\' m on the same side of the door as you are ; secondly , because they \\' re making such a noise inside , no one could possibly hear you .\\' And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within -- a constant howling and sneezing , and every now and then a great crash , as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces . \\' Please , then ,\\' said Alice , \\' how am I to get in ?\\' \\' There might be some sense in your knocking ,\\' the Footman went on without attending to her , \\' if we had the door between us . For instance , if you were INSIDE , you might knock , and I could let you out , you know .\\' He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking , and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil . \\' But perhaps he can \\' t help it ,\\' she said to herself ; \\' his eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his head . But at any rate he might answer questions .-- How am I to get in ?\\' she repeated , aloud . \\' I shall sit here ,\\' the Footman remarked , \\' till tomorrow --\\' At this moment the door of the house opened , and a large plate came skimming out , straight at the Footman \\' s head : it just grazed his nose , and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him . \\'-- or next day , maybe ,\\' the Footman continued in the same tone , exactly as if nothing had happened . \\' How am I to get in ?\\' asked Alice again , in a louder tone . \\' ARE you to get in at all ?\\' said the Footman . \\' That \\' s the first question , you know .\\' It was , no doubt : only Alice did not like to be told so . \\' It \\' s really dreadful ,\\' she muttered to herself , \\' the way all the creatures argue . It \\' s enough to drive one crazy !\\' The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark , with variations . \\' I shall sit here ,\\' he said , \\' on and off , for days and days .\\' \\' But what am I to do ?\\' said Alice . \\' Anything you like ,\\' said the Footman , and began whistling . \\' Oh , there \\' s no use in talking to him ,\\' said Alice desperately : \\' he \\' s perfectly idiotic !\\' And she opened the door and went in . The door led right into a large kitchen , which was full of smoke from one end to the other : the Duchess was sitting on a three - legged stool in the middle , nursing a baby ; the cook was leaning over the fire , stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup . \\' There \\' s certainly too much pepper in that soup !\\' Alice said to herself , as well as she could for sneezing . There was certainly too much of it in the air . Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally ; and as for the baby , it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment \\' s pause . The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze , were the cook , and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear . \\' Please would you tell me ,\\' said Alice , a little timidly , for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first , \\' why your cat grins like that ?\\' \\' It \\' s a Cheshire cat ,\\' said the Duchess , \\' and that \\' s why . Pig !\\' She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped ; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby , and not to her , so she took courage , and went on again :-- \\' I didn \\' t know that Cheshire cats always grinned ; in fact , I didn \\' t know that cats COULD grin .\\' \\' They all can ,\\' said the Duchess ; \\' and most of \\' em do .\\' \\' I don \\' t know of any that do ,\\' Alice said very politely , feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation . \\' You don \\' t know much ,\\' said the Duchess ; \\' and that \\' s a fact .\\' Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark , and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation . While she was trying to fix on one , the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire , and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby -- the fire - irons came first ; then followed a shower of saucepans , plates , and dishes . The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her ; and the baby was howling so much already , that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not . \\' Oh , PLEASE mind what you \\' re doing !\\' cried Alice , jumping up and down in an agony of terror . \\' Oh , there goes his PRECIOUS nose \\'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it , and very nearly carried it off . \\' If everybody minded their own business ,\\' the Duchess said in a hoarse growl , \\' the world would go round a deal faster than it does .\\' \\' Which would NOT be an advantage ,\\' said Alice , who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge . \\' Just think of what work it would make with the day and night ! You see the earth takes twenty - four hours to turn round on its axis --\\' \\' Talking of axes ,\\' said the Duchess , \\' chop off her head !\\' Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook , to see if she meant to take the hint ; but the cook was busily stirring the soup , and seemed not to be listening , so she went on again : \\' Twenty - four hours , I THINK ; or is it twelve ? I --\\' \\' Oh , don \\' t bother ME ,\\' said the Duchess ; \\' I never could abide figures !\\' And with that she began nursing her child again , singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so , and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line : \\' Speak roughly to your little boy , And beat him when he sneezes : He only does it to annoy , Because he knows it teases .\\' CHORUS . ( In which the cook and the baby joined ):-- \\' Wow ! wow ! wow !\\' While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song , she kept tossing the baby violently up and down , and the poor little thing howled so , that Alice could hardly hear the words :-- \\' I speak severely to my boy , I beat him when he sneezes ; For he can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he pleases !\\' CHORUS . \\' Wow ! wow ! wow !\\' \\' Here ! you may nurse it a bit , if you like !\\' the Duchess said to Alice , flinging the baby at her as she spoke . \\' I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen ,\\' and she hurried out of the room . The cook threw a frying - pan after her as she went out , but it just missed her . Alice caught the baby with some difficulty , as it was a queer - shaped little creature , and held out its arms and legs in all directions , \\' just like a star - fish ,\\' thought Alice . The poor little thing was snorting like a steam - engine when she caught it , and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again , so that altogether , for the first minute or two , it was as much as she could do to hold it . As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it , ( which was to twist it up into a sort of knot , and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot , so as to prevent its undoing itself ,) she carried it out into the open air . \\' IF I don \\' t take this child away with me ,\\' thought Alice , \\' they \\' re sure to kill it in a day or two : wouldn \\' t it be murder to leave it behind ?\\' She said the last words out loud , and the little thing grunted in reply ( it had left off sneezing by this time ). \\' Don \\' t grunt ,\\' said Alice ; \\' that \\' s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself .\\' The baby grunted again , and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it . There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn - up nose , much more like a snout than a real nose ; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby : altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all . \\' But perhaps it was only sobbing ,\\' she thought , and looked into its eyes again , to see if there were any tears . No , there were no tears . \\' If you \\' re going to turn into a pig , my dear ,\\' said Alice , seriously , \\' I \\' ll have nothing more to do with you . Mind now !\\' The poor little thing sobbed again ( or grunted , it was impossible to say which ), and they went on for some while in silence . Alice was just beginning to think to herself , \\' Now , what am I to do with this creature when I get it home ?\\' when it grunted again , so violently , that she looked down into its face in some alarm . This time there could be NO mistake about it : it was neither more nor less than a pig , and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further . So she set the little creature down , and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood . \\' If it had grown up ,\\' she said to herself , \\' it would have made a dreadfully ugly child : but it makes rather a handsome pig , I think .\\' And she began thinking over other children she knew , who might do very well as pigs , and was just saying to herself , \\' if one only knew the right way to change them --\\' when she was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off . The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice . It looked good - natured , she thought : still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth , so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect . \\' Cheshire Puss ,\\' she began , rather timidly , as she did not at all know whether it would like the name : however , it only grinned a little wider . \\' Come , it \\' s pleased so far ,\\' thought Alice , and she went on . \\' Would you tell me , please , which way I ought to go from here ?\\' \\' That depends a good deal on where you want to get to ,\\' said the Cat . \\' I don \\' t much care where --\\' said Alice . \\' Then it doesn \\' t matter which way you go ,\\' said the Cat . \\'-- so long as I get SOMEWHERE ,\\' Alice added as an explanation . \\' Oh , you \\' re sure to do that ,\\' said the Cat , \\' if you only walk long enough .\\' Alice felt that this could not be denied , so she tried another question . \\' What sort of people live about here ?\\' \\' In THAT direction ,\\' the Cat said , waving its right paw round , \\' lives a Hatter : and in THAT direction ,\\' waving the other paw , \\' lives a March Hare . Visit either you like : they \\' re both mad .\\' \\' But I don \\' t want to go among mad people ,\\' Alice remarked . \\' Oh , you can \\' t help that ,\\' said the Cat : \\' we \\' re all mad here . I \\' m mad . You \\' re mad .\\' \\' How do you know I \\' m mad ?\\' said Alice . \\' You must be ,\\' said the Cat , \\' or you wouldn \\' t have come here .\\' Alice didn \\' t think that proved it at all ; however , she went on \\' And how do you know that you \\' re mad ?\\' \\' To begin with ,\\' said the Cat , \\' a dog \\' s not mad . You grant that ?\\' \\' I suppose so ,\\' said Alice . \\' Well , then ,\\' the Cat went on , \\' you see , a dog growls when it \\' s angry , and wags its tail when it \\' s pleased . Now I growl when I \\' m pleased , and wag my tail when I \\' m angry . Therefore I \\' m mad .\\' \\' I call it purring , not growling ,\\' said Alice . \\' Call it what you like ,\\' said the Cat . \\' Do you play croquet with the Queen to - day ?\\' \\' I should like it very much ,\\' said Alice , \\' but I haven \\' t been invited yet .\\' \\' You \\' ll see me there ,\\' said the Cat , and vanished . Alice was not much surprised at this , she was getting so used to queer things happening . While she was looking at the place where it had been , it suddenly appeared again . \\' By - the - bye , what became of the baby ?\\' said the Cat . \\' I \\' d nearly forgotten to ask .\\' \\' It turned into a pig ,\\' Alice quietly said , just as if it had come back in a natural way . \\' I thought it would ,\\' said the Cat , and vanished again . Alice waited a little , half expecting to see it again , but it did not appear , and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live . \\' I \\' ve seen hatters before ,\\' she said to herself ; \\' the March Hare will be much the most interesting , and perhaps as this is May it won \\' t be raving mad -- at least not so mad as it was in March .\\' As she said this , she looked up , and there was the Cat again , sitting on a branch of a tree . \\' Did you say pig , or fig ?\\' said the Cat . \\' I said pig ,\\' replied Alice ; \\' and I wish you wouldn \\' t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly : you make one quite giddy .\\' \\' All right ,\\' said the Cat ; and this time it vanished quite slowly , beginning with the end of the tail , and ending with the grin , which remained some time after the rest of it had gone . \\' Well ! I \\' ve often seen a cat without a grin ,\\' thought Alice ; \\' but a grin without a cat ! It \\' s the most curious thing I ever saw in my life !\\' She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the March Hare : she thought it must be the right house , because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur . It was so large a house , that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom , and raised herself to about two feet high : even then she walked up towards it rather timidly , saying to herself \\' Suppose it should be raving mad after all ! I almost wish I \\' d gone to see the Hatter instead !\\' CHAPTER VII . A Mad Tea - Party There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house , and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it : a Dormouse was sitting between them , fast asleep , and the other two were using it as a cushion , resting their elbows on it , and talking over its head . \\' Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse ,\\' thought Alice ; \\' only , as it \\' s asleep , I suppose it doesn \\' t mind .\\' The table was a large one , but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it : \\' No room ! No room !\\' they cried out when they saw Alice coming . \\' There \\' s PLENTY of room !\\' said Alice indignantly , and she sat down in a large arm - chair at one end of the table . \\' Have some wine ,\\' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone . Alice looked all round the table , but there was nothing on it but tea . \\' I don \\' t see any wine ,\\' she remarked . \\' There isn \\' t any ,\\' said the March Hare . \\' Then it wasn \\' t very civil of you to offer it ,\\' said Alice angrily . \\' It wasn \\' t very civil of you to sit down without being invited ,\\' said the March Hare . \\' I didn \\' t know it was YOUR table ,\\' said Alice ; \\' it \\' s laid for a great many more than three .\\' \\' Your hair wants cutting ,\\' said the Hatter . He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity , and this was his first speech . \\' You should learn not to make personal remarks ,\\' Alice said with some severity ; \\' it \\' s very rude .\\' The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this ; but all he SAID was , \\' Why is a raven like a writing - desk ?\\' \\' Come , we shall have some fun now !\\' thought Alice . \\' I \\' m glad they \\' ve begun asking riddles .-- I believe I can guess that ,\\' she added aloud . \\' Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it ?\\' said the March Hare . \\' Exactly so ,\\' said Alice . \\' Then you should say what you mean ,\\' the March Hare went on . \\' I do ,\\' Alice hastily replied ; \\' at least -- at least I mean what I say -- that \\' s the same thing , you know .\\' \\' Not the same thing a bit !\\' said the Hatter . \\' You might just as well say that \" I see what I eat \" is the same thing as \" I eat what I see \"!\\' \\' You might just as well say ,\\' added the March Hare , \\' that \" I like what I get \" is the same thing as \" I get what I like \"!\\' \\' You might just as well say ,\\' added the Dormouse , who seemed to be talking in his sleep , \\' that \" I breathe when I sleep \" is the same thing as \" I sleep when I breathe \"!\\' \\' It IS the same thing with you ,\\' said the Hatter , and here the conversation dropped , and the party sat silent for a minute , while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing - desks , which wasn \\' t much . The Hatter was the first to break the silence . \\' What day of the month is it ?\\' he said , turning to Alice : he had taken his watch out of his pocket , and was looking at it uneasily , shaking it every now and then , and holding it to his ear . Alice considered a little , and then said \\' The fourth .\\' \\' Two days wrong !\\' sighed the Hatter . \\' I told you butter wouldn \\' t suit the works !\\' he added looking angrily at the March Hare . \\' It was the BEST butter ,\\' the March Hare meekly replied . \\' Yes , but some crumbs must have got in as well ,\\' the Hatter grumbled : \\' you shouldn \\' t have put it in with the bread - knife .\\' The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily : then he dipped it into his cup of tea , and looked at it again : but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark , \\' It was the BEST butter , you know .\\' Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity . \\' What a funny watch !\\' she remarked . \\' It tells the day of the month , and doesn \\' t tell what o \\' clock it is !\\' \\' Why should it ?\\' muttered the Hatter . \\' Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is ?\\' \\' Of course not ,\\' Alice replied very readily : \\' but that \\' s because it stays the same year for such a long time together .\\' \\' Which is just the case with MINE ,\\' said the Hatter . Alice felt dreadfully puzzled . The Hatter \\' s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it , and yet it was certainly English . \\' I don \\' t quite understand you ,\\' she said , as politely as she could . \\' The Dormouse is asleep again ,\\' said the Hatter , and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose . The Dormouse shook its head impatiently , and said , without opening its eyes , \\' Of course , of course ; just what I was going to remark myself .\\' \\' Have you guessed the riddle yet ?\\' the Hatter said , turning to Alice again . \\' No , I give it up ,\\' Alice replied : \\' what \\' s the answer ?\\' \\' I haven \\' t the slightest idea ,\\' said the Hatter . \\' Nor I ,\\' said the March Hare . Alice sighed wearily . \\' I think you might do something better with the time ,\\' she said , \\' than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers .\\' \\' If you knew Time as well as I do ,\\' said the Hatter , \\' you wouldn \\' t talk about wasting IT . It \\' s HIM .\\' \\' I don \\' t know what you mean ,\\' said Alice . \\' Of course you don \\' t !\\' the Hatter said , tossing his head contemptuously . \\' I dare say you never even spoke to Time !\\' \\' Perhaps not ,\\' Alice cautiously replied : \\' but I know I have to beat time when I learn music .\\' \\' Ah ! that accounts for it ,\\' said the Hatter . \\' He won \\' t stand beating . Now , if you only kept on good terms with him , he \\' d do almost anything you liked with the clock . For instance , suppose it were nine o \\' clock in the morning , just time to begin lessons : you \\' d only have to whisper a hint to Time , and round goes the clock in a twinkling ! Half - past one , time for dinner !\\' (\\' I only wish it was ,\\' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper .) \\' That would be grand , certainly ,\\' said Alice thoughtfully : \\' but then -- I shouldn \\' t be hungry for it , you know .\\' \\' Not at first , perhaps ,\\' said the Hatter : \\' but you could keep it to half - past one as long as you liked .\\' \\' Is that the way YOU manage ?\\' Alice asked . The Hatter shook his head mournfully . \\' Not I !\\' he replied . \\' We quarrelled last March -- just before HE went mad , you know --\\' ( pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare ,) \\'-- it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts , and I had to sing \" Twinkle , twinkle , little bat ! How I wonder what you \\' re at !\" You know the song , perhaps ?\\' \\' I \\' ve heard something like it ,\\' said Alice . \\' It goes on , you know ,\\' the Hatter continued , \\' in this way :-- \" Up above the world you fly , Like a tea - tray in the sky . Twinkle , twinkle --\"\\' Here the Dormouse shook itself , and began singing in its sleep \\' Twinkle , twinkle , twinkle , twinkle --\\' and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop . \\' Well , I \\' d hardly finished the first verse ,\\' said the Hatter , \\' when the Queen jumped up and bawled out , \" He \\' s murdering the time ! Off with his head !\"\\' \\' How dreadfully savage !\\' exclaimed Alice . \\' And ever since that ,\\' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone , \\' he won \\' t do a thing I ask ! It \\' s always six o \\' clock now .\\' A bright idea came into Alice \\' s head . \\' Is that the reason so many tea - things are put out here ?\\' she asked . \\' Yes , that \\' s it ,\\' said the Hatter with a sigh : \\' it \\' s always tea - time , and we \\' ve no time to wash the things between whiles .\\' \\' Then you keep moving round , I suppose ?\\' said Alice . \\' Exactly so ,\\' said the Hatter : \\' as the things get used up .\\' \\' But what happens when you come to the beginning again ?\\' Alice ventured to ask . \\' Suppose we change the subject ,\\' the March Hare interrupted , yawning . \\' I \\' m getting tired of this . I vote the young lady tells us a story .\\' \\' I \\' m afraid I don \\' t know one ,\\' said Alice , rather alarmed at the proposal . \\' Then the Dormouse shall !\\' they both cried . \\' Wake up , Dormouse !\\' And they pinched it on both sides at once . The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes . \\' I wasn \\' t asleep ,\\' he said in a hoarse , feeble voice : \\' I heard every word you fellows were saying .\\' \\' Tell us a story !\\' said the March Hare . \\' Yes , please do !\\' pleaded Alice . \\' And be quick about it ,\\' added the Hatter , \\' or you \\' ll be asleep again before it \\' s done .\\' \\' Once upon a time there were three little sisters ,\\' the Dormouse began in a great hurry ; \\' and their names were Elsie , Lacie , and Tillie ; and they lived at the bottom of a well --\\' \\' What did they live on ?\\' said Alice , who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking . \\' They lived on treacle ,\\' said the Dormouse , after thinking a minute or two . \\' They couldn \\' t have done that , you know ,\\' Alice gently remarked ; \\' they \\' d have been ill .\\' \\' So they were ,\\' said the Dormouse ; \\' VERY ill .\\' Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like , but it puzzled her too much , so she went on : \\' But why did they live at the bottom of a well ?\\' \\' Take some more tea ,\\' the March Hare said to Alice , very earnestly . \\' I \\' ve had nothing yet ,\\' Alice replied in an offended tone , \\' so I can \\' t take more .\\' \\' You mean you can \\' t take LESS ,\\' said the Hatter : \\' it \\' s very easy to take MORE than nothing .\\' \\' Nobody asked YOUR opinion ,\\' said Alice . \\' Who \\' s making personal remarks now ?\\' the Hatter asked triumphantly . Alice did not quite know what to say to this : so she helped herself to some tea and bread - and - butter , and then turned to the Dormouse , and repeated her question . \\' Why did they live at the bottom of a well ?\\' The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it , and then said , \\' It was a treacle - well .\\' \\' There \\' s no such thing !\\' Alice was beginning very angrily , but the Hatter and the March Hare went \\' Sh ! sh !\\' and the Dormouse sulkily remarked , \\' If you can \\' t be civil , you \\' d better finish the story for yourself .\\' \\' No , please go on !\\' Alice said very humbly ; \\' I won \\' t interrupt again . I dare say there may be ONE .\\' \\' One , indeed !\\' said the Dormouse indignantly . However , he consented to go on . \\' And so these three little sisters -- they were learning to draw , you know --\\' \\' What did they draw ?\\' said Alice , quite forgetting her promise . \\' Treacle ,\\' said the Dormouse , without considering at all this time . \\' I want a clean cup ,\\' interrupted the Hatter : \\' let \\' s all move one place on .\\' He moved on as he spoke , and the Dormouse followed him : the March Hare moved into the Dormouse \\' s place , and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare . The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change : and Alice was a good deal worse off than before , as the March Hare had just upset the milk - jug into his plate . Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again , so she began very cautiously : \\' But I don \\' t understand . Where did they draw the treacle from ?\\' \\' You can draw water out of a water - well ,\\' said the Hatter ; \\' so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle - well -- eh , stupid ?\\' \\' But they were IN the well ,\\' Alice said to the Dormouse , not choosing to notice this last remark . \\' Of course they were \\', said the Dormouse ; \\'-- well in .\\' This answer so confused poor Alice , that she let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it . \\' They were learning to draw ,\\' the Dormouse went on , yawning and rubbing its eyes , for it was getting very sleepy ; \\' and they drew all manner of things -- everything that begins with an M --\\' \\' Why with an M ?\\' said Alice . \\' Why not ?\\' said the March Hare . Alice was silent . The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time , and was going off into a doze ; but , on being pinched by the Hatter , it woke up again with a little shriek , and went on : \\'-- that begins with an M , such as mouse - traps , and the moon , and memory , and muchness -- you know you say things are \" much of a muchness \"-- did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ?\\' \\' Really , now you ask me ,\\' said Alice , very much confused , \\' I don \\' t think --\\' \\' Then you shouldn \\' t talk ,\\' said the Hatter . This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear : she got up in great disgust , and walked off ; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly , and neither of the others took the least notice of her going , though she looked back once or twice , half hoping that they would call after her : the last time she saw them , they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot . \\' At any rate I \\' ll never go THERE again !\\' said Alice as she picked her way through the wood . \\' It \\' s the stupidest tea - party I ever was at in all my life !\\' Just as she said this , she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it . \\' That \\' s very curious !\\' she thought . \\' But everything \\' s curious today . I think I may as well go in at once .\\' And in she went . Once more she found herself in the long hall , and close to the little glass table . \\' Now , I \\' ll manage better this time ,\\' she said to herself , and began by taking the little golden key , and unlocking the door that led into the garden . Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom ( she had kept a piece of it in her pocket ) till she was about a foot high : then she walked down the little passage : and THEN -- she found herself at last in the beautiful garden , among the bright flower - beds and the cool fountains . CHAPTER VIII . The Queen \\' s Croquet - Ground A large rose - tree stood near the entrance of the garden : the roses growing on it were white , but there were three gardeners at it , busily painting them red . Alice thought this a very curious thing , and she went nearer to watch them , and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say , \\' Look out now , Five ! Don \\' t go splashing paint over me like that !\\' \\' I couldn \\' t help it ,\\' said Five , in a sulky tone ; \\' Seven jogged my elbow .\\' On which Seven looked up and said , \\' That \\' s right , Five ! Always lay the blame on others !\\' \\' YOU \\' D better not talk !\\' said Five . \\' I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded !\\' \\' What for ?\\' said the one who had spoken first . \\' That \\' s none of YOUR business , Two !\\' said Seven . \\' Yes , it IS his business !\\' said Five , \\' and I \\' ll tell him -- it was for bringing the cook tulip - roots instead of onions .\\' Seven flung down his brush , and had just begun \\' Well , of all the unjust things --\\' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice , as she stood watching them , and he checked himself suddenly : the others looked round also , and all of them bowed low . \\' Would you tell me ,\\' said Alice , a little timidly , \\' why you are painting those roses ?\\' Five and Seven said nothing , but looked at Two . Two began in a low voice , \\' Why the fact is , you see , Miss , this here ought to have been a RED rose - tree , and we put a white one in by mistake ; and if the Queen was to find it out , we should all have our heads cut off , you know . So you see , Miss , we \\' re doing our best , afore she comes , to --\\' At this moment Five , who had been anxiously looking across the garden , called out \\' The Queen ! The Queen !\\' and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces . There was a sound of many footsteps , and Alice looked round , eager to see the Queen . First came ten soldiers carrying clubs ; these were all shaped like the three gardeners , oblong and flat , with their hands and feet at the corners : next the ten courtiers ; these were ornamented all over with diamonds , and walked two and two , as the soldiers did . After these came the royal children ; there were ten of them , and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand , in couples : they were all ornamented with hearts . Next came the guests , mostly Kings and Queens , and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit : it was talking in a hurried nervous manner , smiling at everything that was said , and went by without noticing her . Then followed the Knave of Hearts , carrying the King \\' s crown on a crimson velvet cushion ; and , last of all this grand procession , came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS . Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners , but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions ; \\' and besides , what would be the use of a procession ,\\' thought she , \\' if people had all to lie down upon their faces , so that they couldn \\' t see it ?\\' So she stood still where she was , and waited . When the procession came opposite to Alice , they all stopped and looked at her , and the Queen said severely \\' Who is this ?\\' She said it to the Knave of Hearts , who only bowed and smiled in reply . \\' Idiot !\\' said the Queen , tossing her head impatiently ; and , turning to Alice , she went on , \\' What \\' s your name , child ?\\' \\' My name is Alice , so please your Majesty ,\\' said Alice very politely ; but she added , to herself , \\' Why , they \\' re only a pack of cards , after all . I needn \\' t be afraid of them !\\' \\' And who are THESE ?\\' said the Queen , pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree ; for , you see , as they were lying on their faces , and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack , she could not tell whether they were gardeners , or soldiers , or courtiers , or three of her own children . \\' How should I know ?\\' said Alice , surprised at her own courage . \\' It \\' s no business of MINE .\\' The Queen turned crimson with fury , and , after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast , screamed \\' Off with her head ! Off --\\' \\' Nonsense !\\' said Alice , very loudly and decidedly , and the Queen was silent . The King laid his hand upon her arm , and timidly said \\' Consider , my dear : she is only a child !\\' The Queen turned angrily away from him , and said to the Knave \\' Turn them over !\\' The Knave did so , very carefully , with one foot . \\' Get up !\\' said the Queen , in a shrill , loud voice , and the three gardeners instantly jumped up , and began bowing to the King , the Queen , the royal children , and everybody else . \\' Leave off that !\\' screamed the Queen . \\' You make me giddy .\\' And then , turning to the rose - tree , she went on , \\' What HAVE you been doing here ?\\' \\' May it please your Majesty ,\\' said Two , in a very humble tone , going down on one knee as he spoke , \\' we were trying --\\' \\' I see !\\' said the Queen , who had meanwhile been examining the roses . \\' Off with their heads !\\' and the procession moved on , three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners , who ran to Alice for protection . \\' You shan \\' t be beheaded !\\' said Alice , and she put them into a large flower - pot that stood near . The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two , looking for them , and then quietly marched off after the others . \\' Are their heads off ?\\' shouted the Queen . \\' Their heads are gone , if it please your Majesty !\\' the soldiers shouted in reply . \\' That \\' s right !\\' shouted the Queen . \\' Can you play croquet ?\\' The soldiers were silent , and looked at Alice , as the question was evidently meant for her . \\' Yes !\\' shouted Alice . \\' Come on , then !\\' roared the Queen , and Alice joined the procession , wondering very much what would happen next . \\' It \\' s -- it \\' s a very fine day !\\' said a timid voice at her side . She was walking by the White Rabbit , who was peeping anxiously into her face . \\' Very ,\\' said Alice : \\'-- where \\' s the Duchess ?\\' \\' Hush ! Hush !\\' said the Rabbit in a low , hurried tone . He looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke , and then raised himself upon tiptoe , put his mouth close to her ear , and whispered \\' She \\' s under sentence of execution .\\' \\' What for ?\\' said Alice . \\' Did you say \" What a pity !\"?\\' the Rabbit asked . \\' No , I didn \\' t ,\\' said Alice : \\' I don \\' t think it \\' s at all a pity . I said \" What for ?\"\\' \\' She boxed the Queen \\' s ears --\\' the Rabbit began . Alice gave a little scream of laughter . \\' Oh , hush !\\' the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone . \\' The Queen will hear you ! You see , she came rather late , and the Queen said --\\' \\' Get to your places !\\' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder , and people began running about in all directions , tumbling up against each other ; however , they got settled down in a minute or two , and the game began . Alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet - ground in her life ; it was all ridges and furrows ; the balls were live hedgehogs , the mallets live flamingoes , and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet , to make the arches . The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo : she succeeded in getting its body tucked away , comfortably enough , under her arm , with its legs hanging down , but generally , just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out , and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head , it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face , with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing : and when she had got its head down , and was going to begin again , it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself , and was in the act of crawling away : besides all this , there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to , and , as the doubled - up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground , Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed . The players all played at once without waiting for turns , quarrelling all the while , and fighting for the hedgehogs ; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion , and went stamping about , and shouting \\' Off with his head !\\' or \\' Off with her head !\\' about once in a minute . Alice began to feel very uneasy : to be sure , she had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen , but she knew that it might happen any minute , \\' and then ,\\' thought she , \\' what would become of me ? They \\' re dreadfully fond of beheading people here ; the great wonder is , that there \\' s any one left alive !\\' She was looking about for some way of escape , and wondering whether she could get away without being seen , when she noticed a curious appearance in the air : it puzzled her very much at first , but , after watching it a minute or two , she made it out to be a grin , and she said to herself \\' It \\' s the Cheshire Cat : now I shall have somebody to talk to .\\' \\' How are you getting on ?\\' said the Cat , as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with . Alice waited till the eyes appeared , and then nodded . \\' It \\' s no use speaking to it ,\\' she thought , \\' till its ears have come , or at least one of them .\\' In another minute the whole head appeared , and then Alice put down her flamingo , and began an account of the game , feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her . The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight , and no more of it appeared . \\' I don \\' t think they play at all fairly ,\\' Alice began , in rather a complaining tone , \\' and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can \\' t hear oneself speak -- and they don \\' t seem to have any rules in particular ; at least , if there are , nobody attends to them -- and you \\' ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive ; for instance , there \\' s the arch I \\' ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground -- and I should have croqueted the Queen \\' s hedgehog just now , only it ran away when it saw mine coming !\\' \\' How do you like the Queen ?\\' said the Cat in a low voice . \\' Not at all ,\\' said Alice : \\' she \\' s so extremely --\\' Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behind her , listening : so she went on , \\'-- likely to win , that it \\' s hardly worth while finishing the game .\\' The Queen smiled and passed on . \\' Who ARE you talking to ?\\' said the King , going up to Alice , and looking at the Cat \\' s head with great curiosity . \\' It \\' s a friend of mine -- a Cheshire Cat ,\\' said Alice : \\' allow me to introduce it .\\' \\' I don \\' t like the look of it at all ,\\' said the King : \\' however , it may kiss my hand if it likes .\\' \\' I \\' d rather not ,\\' the Cat remarked . \\' Don \\' t be impertinent ,\\' said the King , \\' and don \\' t look at me like that !\\' He got behind Alice as he spoke . \\' A cat may look at a king ,\\' said Alice . \\' I \\' ve read that in some book , but I don \\' t remember where .\\' \\' Well , it must be removed ,\\' said the King very decidedly , and he called the Queen , who was passing at the moment , \\' My dear ! I wish you would have this cat removed !\\' The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties , great or small . \\' Off with his head !\\' she said , without even looking round . \\' I \\' ll fetch the executioner myself ,\\' said the King eagerly , and he hurried off . Alice thought she might as well go back , and see how the game was going on , as she heard the Queen \\' s voice in the distance , screaming with passion . She had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns , and she did not like the look of things at all , as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not . So she went in search of her hedgehog . The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog , which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other : the only difficulty was , that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden , where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree . By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back , the fight was over , and both the hedgehogs were out of sight : \\' but it doesn \\' t matter much ,\\' thought Alice , \\' as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground .\\' So she tucked it away under her arm , that it might not escape again , and went back for a little more conversation with her friend . When she got back to the Cheshire Cat , she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it : there was a dispute going on between the executioner , the King , and the Queen , who were all talking at once , while all the rest were quite silent , and looked very uncomfortable . The moment Alice appeared , she was appealed to by all three to settle the question , and they repeated their arguments to her , though , as they all spoke at once , she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said . The executioner \\' s argument was , that you couldn \\' t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from : that he had never had to do such a thing before , and he wasn \\' t going to begin at HIS time of life . The King \\' s argument was , that anything that had a head could be beheaded , and that you weren \\' t to talk nonsense . The Queen \\' s argument was , that if something wasn \\' t done about it in less than no time she \\' d have everybody executed , all round . ( It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious .) Alice could think of nothing else to say but \\' It belongs to the Duchess : you \\' d better ask HER about it .\\' \\' She \\' s in prison ,\\' the Queen said to the executioner : \\' fetch her here .\\' And the executioner went off like an arrow . The Cat \\' s head began fading away the moment he was gone , and , by the time he had come back with the Duchess , it had entirely disappeared ; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it , while the rest of the party went back to the game . CHAPTER IX . The Mock Turtle \\' s Story \\' You can \\' t think how glad I am to see you again , you dear old thing !\\' said the Duchess , as she tucked her arm affectionately into Alice \\' s , and they walked off together . Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper , and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen . \\' When I \\' M a Duchess ,\\' she said to herself , ( not in a very hopeful tone though ), \\' I won \\' t have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL . Soup does very well without -- Maybe it \\' s always pepper that makes people hot - tempered ,\\' she went on , very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule , \\' and vinegar that makes them sour -- and camomile that makes them bitter -- and -- and barley - sugar and such things that make children sweet - tempered . I only wish people knew that : then they wouldn \\' t be so stingy about it , you know --\\' She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time , and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear . \\' You \\' re thinking about something , my dear , and that makes you forget to talk . I can \\' t tell you just now what the moral of that is , but I shall remember it in a bit .\\' \\' Perhaps it hasn \\' t one ,\\' Alice ventured to remark . \\' Tut , tut , child !\\' said the Duchess . \\' Everything \\' s got a moral , if only you can find it .\\' And she squeezed herself up closer to Alice \\' s side as she spoke . Alice did not much like keeping so close to her : first , because the Duchess was VERY ugly ; and secondly , because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice \\' s shoulder , and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin . However , she did not like to be rude , so she bore it as well as she could . \\' The game \\' s going on rather better now ,\\' she said , by way of keeping up the conversation a little . \\'\\' Tis so ,\\' said the Duchess : \\' and the moral of that is --\" Oh , \\' tis love , \\' tis love , that makes the world go round !\"\\' \\' Somebody said ,\\' Alice whispered , \\' that it \\' s done by everybody minding their own business !\\' \\' Ah , well ! It means much the same thing ,\\' said the Duchess , digging her sharp little chin into Alice \\' s shoulder as she added , \\' and the moral of THAT is --\" Take care of the sense , and the sounds will take care of themselves .\"\\' \\' How fond she is of finding morals in things !\\' Alice thought to herself . \\' I dare say you \\' re wondering why I don \\' t put my arm round your waist ,\\' the Duchess said after a pause : \\' the reason is , that I \\' m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo . Shall I try the experiment ?\\' \\' HE might bite ,\\' Alice cautiously replied , not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried . \\' Very true ,\\' said the Duchess : \\' flamingoes and mustard both bite . And the moral of that is --\" Birds of a feather flock together .\"\\' \\' Only mustard isn \\' t a bird ,\\' Alice remarked . \\' Right , as usual ,\\' said the Duchess : \\' what a clear way you have of putting things !\\' \\' It \\' s a mineral , I THINK ,\\' said Alice . \\' Of course it is ,\\' said the Duchess , who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said ; \\' there \\' s a large mustard - mine near here . And the moral of that is --\" The more there is of mine , the less there is of yours .\"\\' \\' Oh , I know !\\' exclaimed Alice , who had not attended to this last remark , \\' it \\' s a vegetable . It doesn \\' t look like one , but it is .\\' \\' I quite agree with you ,\\' said the Duchess ; \\' and the moral of that is --\" Be what you would seem to be \"-- or if you \\' d like it put more simply --\" Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise .\"\\' \\' I think I should understand that better ,\\' Alice said very politely , \\' if I had it written down : but I can \\' t quite follow it as you say it .\\' \\' That \\' s nothing to what I could say if I chose ,\\' the Duchess replied , in a pleased tone . \\' Pray don \\' t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that ,\\' said Alice . \\' Oh , don \\' t talk about trouble !\\' said the Duchess . \\' I make you a present of everything I \\' ve said as yet .\\' \\' A cheap sort of present !\\' thought Alice . \\' I \\' m glad they don \\' t give birthday presents like that !\\' But she did not venture to say it out loud . \\' Thinking again ?\\' the Duchess asked , with another dig of her sharp little chin . \\' I \\' ve a right to think ,\\' said Alice sharply , for she was beginning to feel a little worried . \\' Just about as much right ,\\' said the Duchess , \\' as pigs have to fly ; and the m --\\' But here , to Alice \\' s great surprise , the Duchess \\' s voice died away , even in the middle of her favourite word \\' moral ,\\' and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble . Alice looked up , and there stood the Queen in front of them , with her arms folded , frowning like a thunderstorm . \\' A fine day , your Majesty !\\' the Duchess began in a low , weak voice . \\' Now , I give you fair warning ,\\' shouted the Queen , stamping on the ground as she spoke ; \\' either you or your head must be off , and that in about half no time ! Take your choice !\\' The Duchess took her choice , and was gone in a moment . \\' Let \\' s go on with the game ,\\' the Queen said to Alice ; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word , but slowly followed her back to the croquet - ground . The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen \\' s absence , and were resting in the shade : however , the moment they saw her , they hurried back to the game , the Queen merely remarking that a moment \\' s delay would cost them their lives . All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players , and shouting \\' Off with his head !\\' or \\' Off with her head !\\' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers , who of course had to leave off being arches to do this , so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left , and all the players , except the King , the Queen , and Alice , were in custody and under sentence of execution . Then the Queen left off , quite out of breath , and said to Alice , \\' Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet ?\\' \\' No ,\\' said Alice . \\' I don \\' t even know what a Mock Turtle is .\\' \\' It \\' s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from ,\\' said the Queen . \\' I never saw one , or heard of one ,\\' said Alice . \\' Come on , then ,\\' said the Queen , \\' and he shall tell you his history ,\\' As they walked off together , Alice heard the King say in a low voice , to the company generally , \\' You are all pardoned .\\' \\' Come , THAT \\' S a good thing !\\' she said to herself , for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered . They very soon came upon a Gryphon , lying fast asleep in the sun . ( IF you don \\' t know what a Gryphon is , look at the picture .) \\' Up , lazy thing !\\' said the Queen , \\' and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle , and to hear his history . I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered \\'; and she walked off , leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon . Alice did not quite like the look of the creature , but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen : so she waited . The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes : then it watched the Queen till she was out of sight : then it chuckled . \\' What fun !\\' said the Gryphon , half to itself , half to Alice . \\' What IS the fun ?\\' said Alice . \\' Why , SHE ,\\' said the Gryphon . \\' It \\' s all her fancy , that : they never executes nobody , you know . Come on !\\' \\' Everybody says \" come on !\" here ,\\' thought Alice , as she went slowly after it : \\' I never was so ordered about in all my life , never !\\' They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance , sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock , and , as they came nearer , Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break . She pitied him deeply . \\' What is his sorrow ?\\' she asked the Gryphon , and the Gryphon answered , very nearly in the same words as before , \\' It \\' s all his fancy , that : he hasn \\' t got no sorrow , you know . Come on !\\' So they went up to the Mock Turtle , who looked at them with large eyes full of tears , but said nothing . \\' This here young lady ,\\' said the Gryphon , \\' she wants for to know your history , she do .\\' \\' I \\' ll tell it her ,\\' said the Mock Turtle in a deep , hollow tone : \\' sit down , both of you , and don \\' t speak a word till I \\' ve finished .\\' So they sat down , and nobody spoke for some minutes . Alice thought to herself , \\' I don \\' t see how he can EVEN finish , if he doesn \\' t begin .\\' But she waited patiently . \\' Once ,\\' said the Mock Turtle at last , with a deep sigh , \\' I was a real Turtle .\\' These words were followed by a very long silence , broken only by an occasional exclamation of \\' Hjckrrh !\\' from the Gryphon , and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle . Alice was very nearly getting up and saying , \\' Thank you , sir , for your interesting story ,\\' but she could not help thinking there MUST be more to come , so she sat still and said nothing . \\' When we were little ,\\' the Mock Turtle went on at last , more calmly , though still sobbing a little now and then , \\' we went to school in the sea . The master was an old Turtle -- we used to call him Tortoise --\\' \\' Why did you call him Tortoise , if he wasn \\' t one ?\\' Alice asked . \\' We called him Tortoise because he taught us ,\\' said the Mock Turtle angrily : \\' really you are very dull !\\' \\' You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question ,\\' added the Gryphon ; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice , who felt ready to sink into the earth . At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle , \\' Drive on , old fellow ! Don \\' t be all day about it !\\' and he went on in these words : \\' Yes , we went to school in the sea , though you mayn \\' t believe it --\\' \\' I never said I didn \\' t !\\' interrupted Alice . \\' You did ,\\' said the Mock Turtle . \\' Hold your tongue !\\' added the Gryphon , before Alice could speak again . The Mock Turtle went on . \\' We had the best of educations -- in fact , we went to school every day --\\' \\' I \\' VE been to a day - school , too ,\\' said Alice ; \\' you needn \\' t be so proud as all that .\\' \\' With extras ?\\' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously . \\' Yes ,\\' said Alice , \\' we learned French and music .\\' \\' And washing ?\\' said the Mock Turtle . \\' Certainly not !\\' said Alice indignantly . \\' Ah ! then yours wasn \\' t a really good school ,\\' said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief . \\' Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill , \" French , music , AND WASHING -- extra .\"\\' \\' You couldn \\' t have wanted it much ,\\' said Alice ; \\' living at the bottom of the sea .\\' \\' I couldn \\' t afford to learn it .\\' said the Mock Turtle with a sigh . \\' I only took the regular course .\\' \\' What was that ?\\' inquired Alice . \\' Reeling and Writhing , of course , to begin with ,\\' the Mock Turtle replied ; \\' and then the different branches of Arithmetic -- Ambition , Distraction , Uglification , and Derision .\\' \\' I never heard of \" Uglification ,\"\\' Alice ventured to say . \\' What is it ?\\' The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise . \\' What ! Never heard of uglifying !\\' it exclaimed . \\' You know what to beautify is , I suppose ?\\' \\' Yes ,\\' said Alice doubtfully : \\' it means -- to -- make -- anything -- prettier .\\' \\' Well , then ,\\' the Gryphon went on , \\' if you don \\' t know what to uglify is , you ARE a simpleton .\\' Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it , so she turned to the Mock Turtle , and said \\' What else had you to learn ?\\' \\' Well , there was Mystery ,\\' the Mock Turtle replied , counting off the subjects on his flappers , \\'-- Mystery , ancient and modern , with Seaography : then Drawling -- the Drawling - master was an old conger - eel , that used to come once a week : HE taught us Drawling , Stretching , and Fainting in Coils .\\' \\' What was THAT like ?\\' said Alice . \\' Well , I can \\' t show it you myself ,\\' the Mock Turtle said : \\' I \\' m too stiff . And the Gryphon never learnt it .\\' \\' Hadn \\' t time ,\\' said the Gryphon : \\' I went to the Classics master , though . He was an old crab , HE was .\\' \\' I never went to him ,\\' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh : \\' he taught Laughing and Grief , they used to say .\\' \\' So he did , so he did ,\\' said the Gryphon , sighing in his turn ; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws . \\' And how many hours a day did you do lessons ?\\' said Alice , in a hurry to change the subject . \\' Ten hours the first day ,\\' said the Mock Turtle : \\' nine the next , and so on .\\' \\' What a curious plan !\\' exclaimed Alice . \\' That \\' s the reason they \\' re called lessons ,\\' the Gryphon remarked : \\' because they lessen from day to day .\\' This was quite a new idea to Alice , and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark . \\' Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday ?\\' \\' Of course it was ,\\' said the Mock Turtle . \\' And how did you manage on the twelfth ?\\' Alice went on eagerly . \\' That \\' s enough about lessons ,\\' the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone : \\' tell her something about the games now .\\' CHAPTER X . The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes . He looked at Alice , and tried to speak , but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice . \\' Same as if he had a bone in his throat ,\\' said the Gryphon : and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back . At last the Mock Turtle recovered his voice , and , with tears running down his cheeks , he went on again :-- \\' You may not have lived much under the sea --\\' (\\' I haven \\' t ,\\' said Alice )--\\' and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster --\\' ( Alice began to say \\' I once tasted --\\' but checked herself hastily , and said \\' No , never \\') \\'-- so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is !\\' \\' No , indeed ,\\' said Alice . \\' What sort of a dance is it ?\\' \\' Why ,\\' said the Gryphon , \\' you first form into a line along the sea - shore --\\' \\' Two lines !\\' cried the Mock Turtle . \\' Seals , turtles , salmon , and so on ; then , when you \\' ve cleared all the jelly - fish out of the way --\\' \\' THAT generally takes some time ,\\' interrupted the Gryphon . \\'-- you advance twice --\\' \\' Each with a lobster as a partner !\\' cried the Gryphon . \\' Of course ,\\' the Mock Turtle said : \\' advance twice , set to partners --\\' \\'-- change lobsters , and retire in same order ,\\' continued the Gryphon . \\' Then , you know ,\\' the Mock Turtle went on , \\' you throw the --\\' \\' The lobsters !\\' shouted the Gryphon , with a bound into the air . \\'-- as far out to sea as you can --\\' \\' Swim after them !\\' screamed the Gryphon . \\' Turn a somersault in the sea !\\' cried the Mock Turtle , capering wildly about . \\' Change lobsters again !\\' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice . \\' Back to land again , and that \\' s all the first figure ,\\' said the Mock Turtle , suddenly dropping his voice ; and the two creatures , who had been jumping about like mad things all this time , sat down again very sadly and quietly , and looked at Alice . \\' It must be a very pretty dance ,\\' said Alice timidly . \\' Would you like to see a little of it ?\\' said the Mock Turtle . \\' Very much indeed ,\\' said Alice . \\' Come , let \\' s try the first figure !\\' said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon . \\' We can do without lobsters , you know . Which shall sing ?\\' \\' Oh , YOU sing ,\\' said the Gryphon . \\' I \\' ve forgotten the words .\\' So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice , every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close , and waving their forepaws to mark the time , while the Mock Turtle sang this , very slowly and sadly :-- \\'\" Will you walk a little faster ?\" said a whiting to a snail . \" There \\' s a porpoise close behind us , and he \\' s treading on my tail . See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance ! They are waiting on the shingle -- will you come and join the dance ? Will you , won \\' t you , will you , won \\' t you , will you join the dance ? Will you , won \\' t you , will you , won \\' t you , won \\' t you join the dance ? \" You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us , with the lobsters , out to sea !\" But the snail replied \" Too far , too far !\" and gave a look askance -- Said he thanked the whiting kindly , but he would not join the dance . Would not , could not , would not , could not , would not join the dance . Would not , could not , would not , could not , could not join the dance . \\'\" What matters it how far we go ?\" his scaly friend replied . \" There is another shore , you know , upon the other side . The further off from England the nearer is to France -- Then turn not pale , beloved snail , but come and join the dance . Will you , won \\' t you , will you , won \\' t you , will you join the dance ? Will you , won \\' t you , will you , won \\' t you , won \\' t you join the dance ?\"\\' \\' Thank you , it \\' s a very interesting dance to watch ,\\' said Alice , feeling very glad that it was over at last : \\' and I do so like that curious song about the whiting !\\' \\' Oh , as to the whiting ,\\' said the Mock Turtle , \\' they -- you \\' ve seen them , of course ?\\' \\' Yes ,\\' said Alice , \\' I \\' ve often seen them at dinn --\\' she checked herself hastily . \\' I don \\' t know where Dinn may be ,\\' said the Mock Turtle , \\' but if you \\' ve seen them so often , of course you know what they \\' re like .\\' \\' I believe so ,\\' Alice replied thoughtfully . \\' They have their tails in their mouths -- and they \\' re all over crumbs .\\' \\' You \\' re wrong about the crumbs ,\\' said the Mock Turtle : \\' crumbs would all wash off in the sea . But they HAVE their tails in their mouths ; and the reason is --\\' here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his eyes .--\\' Tell her about the reason and all that ,\\' he said to the Gryphon . \\' The reason is ,\\' said the Gryphon , \\' that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance . So they got thrown out to sea . So they had to fall a long way . So they got their tails fast in their mouths . So they couldn \\' t get them out again . That \\' s all .\\' \\' Thank you ,\\' said Alice , \\' it \\' s very interesting . I never knew so much about a whiting before .\\' \\' I can tell you more than that , if you like ,\\' said the Gryphon . \\' Do you know why it \\' s called a whiting ?\\' \\' I never thought about it ,\\' said Alice . \\' Why ?\\' \\' IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES .\\' the Gryphon replied very solemnly . Alice was thoroughly puzzled . \\' Does the boots and shoes !\\' she repeated in a wondering tone . \\' Why , what are YOUR shoes done with ?\\' said the Gryphon . \\' I mean , what makes them so shiny ?\\' Alice looked down at them , and considered a little before she gave her answer . \\' They \\' re done with blacking , I believe .\\' \\' Boots and shoes under the sea ,\\' the Gryphon went on in a deep voice , \\' are done with a whiting . Now you know .\\' \\' And what are they made of ?\\' Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity . \\' Soles and eels , of course ,\\' the Gryphon replied rather impatiently : \\' any shrimp could have told you that .\\' \\' If I \\' d been the whiting ,\\' said Alice , whose thoughts were still running on the song , \\' I \\' d have said to the porpoise , \" Keep back , please : we don \\' t want YOU with us !\"\\' \\' They were obliged to have him with them ,\\' the Mock Turtle said : \\' no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise .\\' \\' Wouldn \\' t it really ?\\' said Alice in a tone of great surprise . \\' Of course not ,\\' said the Mock Turtle : \\' why , if a fish came to ME , and told me he was going a journey , I should say \" With what porpoise ?\"\\' \\' Don \\' t you mean \" purpose \"?\\' said Alice . \\' I mean what I say ,\\' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone . And the Gryphon added \\' Come , let \\' s hear some of YOUR adventures .\\' \\' I could tell you my adventures -- beginning from this morning ,\\' said Alice a little timidly : \\' but it \\' s no use going back to yesterday , because I was a different person then .\\' \\' Explain all that ,\\' said the Mock Turtle . \\' No , no ! The adventures first ,\\' said the Gryphon in an impatient tone : \\' explanations take such a dreadful time .\\' So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the White Rabbit . She was a little nervous about it just at first , the two creatures got so close to her , one on each side , and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide , but she gained courage as she went on . Her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating \\' YOU ARE OLD , FATHER WILLIAM ,\\' to the Caterpillar , and the words all coming different , and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath , and said \\' That \\' s very curious .\\' \\' It \\' s all about as curious as it can be ,\\' said the Gryphon . \\' It all came different !\\' the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully . \\' I should like to hear her try and repeat something now . Tell her to begin .\\' He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice . \\' Stand up and repeat \"\\' TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD ,\"\\' said the Gryphon . \\' How the creatures order one about , and make one repeat lessons !\\' thought Alice ; \\' I might as well be at school at once .\\' However , she got up , and began to repeat it , but her head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille , that she hardly knew what she was saying , and the words came very queer indeed :-- \\'\\' Tis the voice of the Lobster ; I heard him declare , \" You have baked me too brown , I must sugar my hair .\" As a duck with its eyelids , so he with his nose Trims his belt and his buttons , and turns out his toes .\\' [ later editions continued as follows When the sands are all dry , he is gay as a lark , And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark , But , when the tide rises and sharks are around , His voice has a timid and tremulous sound .] \\' That \\' s different from what I used to say when I was a child ,\\' said the Gryphon . \\' Well , I never heard it before ,\\' said the Mock Turtle ; \\' but it sounds uncommon nonsense .\\' Alice said nothing ; she had sat down with her face in her hands , wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again . \\' I should like to have it explained ,\\' said the Mock Turtle . \\' She can \\' t explain it ,\\' said the Gryphon hastily . \\' Go on with the next verse .\\' \\' But about his toes ?\\' the Mock Turtle persisted . \\' How COULD he turn them out with his nose , you know ?\\' \\' It \\' s the first position in dancing .\\' Alice said ; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing , and longed to change the subject . \\' Go on with the next verse ,\\' the Gryphon repeated impatiently : \\' it begins \" I passed by his garden .\"\\' Alice did not dare to disobey , though she felt sure it would all come wrong , and she went on in a trembling voice :-- \\' I passed by his garden , and marked , with one eye , How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie --\\' [ later editions continued as follows The Panther took pie - crust , and gravy , and meat , While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat . When the pie was all finished , the Owl , as a boon , Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon : While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl , And concluded the banquet --] \\' What IS the use of repeating all that stuff ,\\' the Mock Turtle interrupted , \\' if you don \\' t explain it as you go on ? It \\' s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard !\\' \\' Yes , I think you \\' d better leave off ,\\' said the Gryphon : and Alice was only too glad to do so . \\' Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille ?\\' the Gryphon went on . \\' Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song ?\\' \\' Oh , a song , please , if the Mock Turtle would be so kind ,\\' Alice replied , so eagerly that the Gryphon said , in a rather offended tone , \\' Hm ! No accounting for tastes ! Sing her \" Turtle Soup ,\" will you , old fellow ?\\' The Mock Turtle sighed deeply , and began , in a voice sometimes choked with sobs , to sing this :-- \\' Beautiful Soup , so rich and green , Waiting in a hot tureen ! Who for such dainties would not stoop ? Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup ! Soup of the evening , beautiful Soup ! Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop ! Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop ! Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup ! \\' Beautiful Soup ! Who cares for fish , Game , or any other dish ? Who would not give all else for two Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup ? Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup ? Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop ! Beau -- ootiful Soo -- oop ! Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beauti -- FUL SOUP !\\' \\' Chorus again !\\' cried the Gryphon , and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it , when a cry of \\' The trial \\' s beginning !\\' was heard in the distance . \\' Come on !\\' cried the Gryphon , and , taking Alice by the hand , it hurried off , without waiting for the end of the song . \\' What trial is it ?\\' Alice panted as she ran ; but the Gryphon only answered \\' Come on !\\' and ran the faster , while more and more faintly came , carried on the breeze that followed them , the melancholy words :-- \\' Soo -- oop of the e -- e -- evening , Beautiful , beautiful Soup !\\' CHAPTER XI . Who Stole the Tarts ? The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived , with a great crowd assembled about them -- all sorts of little birds and beasts , as well as the whole pack of cards : the Knave was standing before them , in chains , with a soldier on each side to guard him ; and near the King was the White Rabbit , with a trumpet in one hand , and a scroll of parchment in the other . In the very middle of the court was a table , with a large dish of tarts upon it : they looked so good , that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them --\\' I wish they \\' d get the trial done ,\\' she thought , \\' and hand round the refreshments !\\' But there seemed to be no chance of this , so she began looking at everything about her , to pass away the time . Alice had never been in a court of justice before , but she had read about them in books , and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there . \\' That \\' s the judge ,\\' she said to herself , \\' because of his great wig .\\' The judge , by the way , was the King ; and as he wore his crown over the wig , ( look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it ,) he did not look at all comfortable , and it was certainly not becoming . \\' And that \\' s the jury - box ,\\' thought Alice , \\' and those twelve creatures ,\\' ( she was obliged to say \\' creatures ,\\' you see , because some of them were animals , and some were birds ,) \\' I suppose they are the jurors .\\' She said this last word two or three times over to herself , being rather proud of it : for she thought , and rightly too , that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all . However , \\' jury - men \\' would have done just as well . The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates . \\' What are they doing ?\\' Alice whispered to the Gryphon . \\' They can \\' t have anything to put down yet , before the trial \\' s begun .\\' \\' They \\' re putting down their names ,\\' the Gryphon whispered in reply , \\' for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial .\\' \\' Stupid things !\\' Alice began in a loud , indignant voice , but she stopped hastily , for the White Rabbit cried out , \\' Silence in the court !\\' and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round , to make out who was talking . Alice could see , as well as if she were looking over their shoulders , that all the jurors were writing down \\' stupid things !\\' on their slates , and she could even make out that one of them didn \\' t know how to spell \\' stupid ,\\' and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him . \\' A nice muddle their slates \\' ll be in before the trial \\' s over !\\' thought Alice . One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked . This of course , Alice could not stand , and she went round the court and got behind him , and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away . She did it so quickly that the poor little juror ( it was Bill , the Lizard ) could not make out at all what had become of it ; so , after hunting all about for it , he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day ; and this was of very little use , as it left no mark on the slate . \\' Herald , read the accusation !\\' said the King . On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet , and then unrolled the parchment scroll , and read as follows :-- \\' The Queen of Hearts , she made some tarts , All on a summer day : The Knave of Hearts , he stole those tarts , And took them quite away !\\' \\' Consider your verdict ,\\' the King said to the jury . \\' Not yet , not yet !\\' the Rabbit hastily interrupted . \\' There \\' s a great deal to come before that !\\' \\' Call the first witness ,\\' said the King ; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet , and called out , \\' First witness !\\' The first witness was the Hatter . He came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread - and - butter in the other . \\' I beg pardon , your Majesty ,\\' he began , \\' for bringing these in : but I hadn \\' t quite finished my tea when I was sent for .\\' \\' You ought to have finished ,\\' said the King . \\' When did you begin ?\\' The Hatter looked at the March Hare , who had followed him into the court , arm - in - arm with the Dormouse . \\' Fourteenth of March , I think it was ,\\' he said . \\' Fifteenth ,\\' said the March Hare . \\' Sixteenth ,\\' added the Dormouse . \\' Write that down ,\\' the King said to the jury , and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates , and then added them up , and reduced the answer to shillings and pence . \\' Take off your hat ,\\' the King said to the Hatter . \\' It isn \\' t mine ,\\' said the Hatter . \\' Stolen !\\' the King exclaimed , turning to the jury , who instantly made a memorandum of the fact . \\' I keep them to sell ,\\' the Hatter added as an explanation ; \\' I \\' ve none of my own . I \\' m a hatter .\\' Here the Queen put on her spectacles , and began staring at the Hatter , who turned pale and fidgeted . \\' Give your evidence ,\\' said the King ; \\' and don \\' t be nervous , or I \\' ll have you executed on the spot .\\' This did not seem to encourage the witness at all : he kept shifting from one foot to the other , looking uneasily at the Queen , and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread - and - butter . Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation , which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was : she was beginning to grow larger again , and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court ; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her . \\' I wish you wouldn \\' t squeeze so .\\' said the Dormouse , who was sitting next to her . \\' I can hardly breathe .\\' \\' I can \\' t help it ,\\' said Alice very meekly : \\' I \\' m growing .\\' \\' You \\' ve no right to grow here ,\\' said the Dormouse . \\' Don \\' t talk nonsense ,\\' said Alice more boldly : \\' you know you \\' re growing too .\\' \\' Yes , but I grow at a reasonable pace ,\\' said the Dormouse : \\' not in that ridiculous fashion .\\' And he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court . All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter , and , just as the Dormouse crossed the court , she said to one of the officers of the court , \\' Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert !\\' on which the wretched Hatter trembled so , that he shook both his shoes off . \\' Give your evidence ,\\' the King repeated angrily , \\' or I \\' ll have you executed , whether you \\' re nervous or not .\\' \\' I \\' m a poor man , your Majesty ,\\' the Hatter began , in a trembling voice , \\'-- and I hadn \\' t begun my tea -- not above a week or so -- and what with the bread - and - butter getting so thin -- and the twinkling of the tea --\\' \\' The twinkling of the what ?\\' said the King . \\' It began with the tea ,\\' the Hatter replied . \\' Of course twinkling begins with a T !\\' said the King sharply . \\' Do you take me for a dunce ? Go on !\\' \\' I \\' m a poor man ,\\' the Hatter went on , \\' and most things twinkled after that -- only the March Hare said --\\' \\' I didn \\' t !\\' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry . \\' You did !\\' said the Hatter . \\' I deny it !\\' said the March Hare . \\' He denies it ,\\' said the King : \\' leave out that part .\\' \\' Well , at any rate , the Dormouse said --\\' the Hatter went on , looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too : but the Dormouse denied nothing , being fast asleep . \\' After that ,\\' continued the Hatter , \\' I cut some more bread - and - butter --\\' \\' But what did the Dormouse say ?\\' one of the jury asked . \\' That I can \\' t remember ,\\' said the Hatter . \\' You MUST remember ,\\' remarked the King , \\' or I \\' ll have you executed .\\' The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread - and - butter , and went down on one knee . \\' I \\' m a poor man , your Majesty ,\\' he began . \\' You \\' re a very poor speaker ,\\' said the King . Here one of the guinea - pigs cheered , and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court . ( As that is rather a hard word , I will just explain to you how it was done . They had a large canvas bag , which tied up at the mouth with strings : into this they slipped the guinea - pig , head first , and then sat upon it .) \\' I \\' m glad I \\' ve seen that done ,\\' thought Alice . \\' I \\' ve so often read in the newspapers , at the end of trials , \" There was some attempts at applause , which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court ,\" and I never understood what it meant till now .\\' \\' If that \\' s all you know about it , you may stand down ,\\' continued the King . \\' I can \\' t go no lower ,\\' said the Hatter : \\' I \\' m on the floor , as it is .\\' \\' Then you may SIT down ,\\' the King replied . Here the other guinea - pig cheered , and was suppressed . \\' Come , that finished the guinea - pigs !\\' thought Alice . \\' Now we shall get on better .\\' \\' I \\' d rather finish my tea ,\\' said the Hatter , with an anxious look at the Queen , who was reading the list of singers . \\' You may go ,\\' said the King , and the Hatter hurriedly left the court , without even waiting to put his shoes on . \\'-- and just take his head off outside ,\\' the Queen added to one of the officers : but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door . \\' Call the next witness !\\' said the King . The next witness was the Duchess \\' s cook . She carried the pepper - box in her hand , and Alice guessed who it was , even before she got into the court , by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once . \\' Give your evidence ,\\' said the King . \\' Shan \\' t ,\\' said the cook . The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit , who said in a low voice , \\' Your Majesty must cross - examine THIS witness .\\' \\' Well , if I must , I must ,\\' the King said , with a melancholy air , and , after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight , he said in a deep voice , \\' What are tarts made of ?\\' \\' Pepper , mostly ,\\' said the cook . \\' Treacle ,\\' said a sleepy voice behind her . \\' Collar that Dormouse ,\\' the Queen shrieked out . \\' Behead that Dormouse ! Turn that Dormouse out of court ! Suppress him ! Pinch him ! Off with his whiskers !\\' For some minutes the whole court was in confusion , getting the Dormouse turned out , and , by the time they had settled down again , the cook had disappeared . \\' Never mind !\\' said the King , with an air of great relief . \\' Call the next witness .\\' And he added in an undertone to the Queen , \\' Really , my dear , YOU must cross - examine the next witness . It quite makes my forehead ache !\\' Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list , feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like , \\'-- for they haven \\' t got much evidence YET ,\\' she said to herself . Imagine her surprise , when the White Rabbit read out , at the top of his shrill little voice , the name \\' Alice !\\' CHAPTER XII Alice \\' s Evidence \\' Here !\\' cried Alice , quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes , and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury - box with the edge of her skirt , upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below , and there they lay sprawling about , reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before . \\' Oh , I BEG your pardon !\\' she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay , and began picking them up again as quickly as she could , for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head , and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury - box , or they would die . \\' The trial cannot proceed ,\\' said the King in a very grave voice , \\' until all the jurymen are back in their proper places -- ALL ,\\' he repeated with great emphasis , looking hard at Alice as he said do . Alice looked at the jury - box , and saw that , in her haste , she had put the Lizard in head downwards , and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way , being quite unable to move . She soon got it out again , and put it right ; \\' not that it signifies much ,\\' she said to herself ; \\' I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other .\\' As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset , and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them , they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident , all except the Lizard , who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open , gazing up into the roof of the court . \\' What do you know about this business ?\\' the King said to Alice . \\' Nothing ,\\' said Alice . \\' Nothing WHATEVER ?\\' persisted the King . \\' Nothing whatever ,\\' said Alice . \\' That \\' s very important ,\\' the King said , turning to the jury . They were just beginning to write this down on their slates , when the White Rabbit interrupted : \\' UNimportant , your Majesty means , of course ,\\' he said in a very respectful tone , but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke . \\' UNimportant , of course , I meant ,\\' the King hastily said , and went on to himself in an undertone , \\' important -- unimportant -- unimportant -- important --\\' as if he were trying which word sounded best . Some of the jury wrote it down \\' important ,\\' and some \\' unimportant .\\' Alice could see this , as she was near enough to look over their slates ; \\' but it doesn \\' t matter a bit ,\\' she thought to herself . At this moment the King , who had been for some time busily writing in his note - book , cackled out \\' Silence !\\' and read out from his book , \\' Rule Forty - two . ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT .\\' Everybody looked at Alice . \\' I \\' M not a mile high ,\\' said Alice . \\' You are ,\\' said the King . \\' Nearly two miles high ,\\' added the Queen . \\' Well , I shan \\' t go , at any rate ,\\' said Alice : \\' besides , that \\' s not a regular rule : you invented it just now .\\' \\' It \\' s the oldest rule in the book ,\\' said the King . \\' Then it ought to be Number One ,\\' said Alice . The King turned pale , and shut his note - book hastily . \\' Consider your verdict ,\\' he said to the jury , in a low , trembling voice . \\' There \\' s more evidence to come yet , please your Majesty ,\\' said the White Rabbit , jumping up in a great hurry ; \\' this paper has just been picked up .\\' \\' What \\' s in it ?\\' said the Queen . \\' I haven \\' t opened it yet ,\\' said the White Rabbit , \\' but it seems to be a letter , written by the prisoner to -- to somebody .\\' \\' It must have been that ,\\' said the King , \\' unless it was written to nobody , which isn \\' t usual , you know .\\' \\' Who is it directed to ?\\' said one of the jurymen . \\' It isn \\' t directed at all ,\\' said the White Rabbit ; \\' in fact , there \\' s nothing written on the OUTSIDE .\\' He unfolded the paper as he spoke , and added \\' It isn \\' t a letter , after all : it \\' s a set of verses .\\' \\' Are they in the prisoner \\' s handwriting ?\\' asked another of the jurymen . \\' No , they \\' re not ,\\' said the White Rabbit , \\' and that \\' s the queerest thing about it .\\' ( The jury all looked puzzled .) \\' He must have imitated somebody else \\' s hand ,\\' said the King . ( The jury all brightened up again .) \\' Please your Majesty ,\\' said the Knave , \\' I didn \\' t write it , and they can \\' t prove I did : there \\' s no name signed at the end .\\' \\' If you didn \\' t sign it ,\\' said the King , \\' that only makes the matter worse . You MUST have meant some mischief , or else you \\' d have signed your name like an honest man .\\' There was a general clapping of hands at this : it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day . \\' That PROVES his guilt ,\\' said the Queen . \\' It proves nothing of the sort !\\' said Alice . \\' Why , you don \\' t even know what they \\' re about !\\' \\' Read them ,\\' said the King . The White Rabbit put on his spectacles . \\' Where shall I begin , please your Majesty ?\\' he asked . \\' Begin at the beginning ,\\' the King said gravely , \\' and go on till you come to the end : then stop .\\' These were the verses the White Rabbit read :-- \\' They told me you had been to her , And mentioned me to him : She gave me a good character , But said I could not swim . He sent them word I had not gone ( We know it to be true ): If she should push the matter on , What would become of you ? I gave her one , they gave him two , You gave us three or more ; They all returned from him to you , Though they were mine before . If I or she should chance to be Involved in this affair , He trusts to you to set them free , Exactly as we were . My notion was that you had been ( Before she had this fit ) An obstacle that came between Him , and ourselves , and it . Don \\' t let him know she liked them best , For this must ever be A secret , kept from all the rest , Between yourself and me .\\' \\' That \\' s the most important piece of evidence we \\' ve heard yet ,\\' said the King , rubbing his hands ; \\' so now let the jury --\\' \\' If any one of them can explain it ,\\' said Alice , ( she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn \\' t a bit afraid of interrupting him ,) \\' I \\' ll give him sixpence . _I_ don \\' t believe there \\' s an atom of meaning in it .\\' The jury all wrote down on their slates , \\' SHE doesn \\' t believe there \\' s an atom of meaning in it ,\\' but none of them attempted to explain the paper . \\' If there \\' s no meaning in it ,\\' said the King , \\' that saves a world of trouble , you know , as we needn \\' t try to find any . And yet I don \\' t know ,\\' he went on , spreading out the verses on his knee , and looking at them with one eye ; \\' I seem to see some meaning in them , after all . \"-- SAID I COULD NOT SWIM --\" you can \\' t swim , can you ?\\' he added , turning to the Knave . The Knave shook his head sadly . \\' Do I look like it ?\\' he said . ( Which he certainly did NOT , being made entirely of cardboard .) \\' All right , so far ,\\' said the King , and he went on muttering over the verses to himself : \\'\" WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE --\" that \\' s the jury , of course --\" I GAVE HER ONE , THEY GAVE HIM TWO --\" why , that must be what he did with the tarts , you know --\\' \\' But , it goes on \" THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU ,\"\\' said Alice . \\' Why , there they are !\\' said the King triumphantly , pointing to the tarts on the table . \\' Nothing can be clearer than THAT . Then again --\" BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT --\" you never had fits , my dear , I think ?\\' he said to the Queen . \\' Never !\\' said the Queen furiously , throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke . ( The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger , as he found it made no mark ; but he now hastily began again , using the ink , that was trickling down his face , as long as it lasted .) \\' Then the words don \\' t FIT you ,\\' said the King , looking round the court with a smile . There was a dead silence . \\' It \\' s a pun !\\' the King added in an offended tone , and everybody laughed , \\' Let the jury consider their verdict ,\\' the King said , for about the twentieth time that day . \\' No , no !\\' said the Queen . \\' Sentence first -- verdict afterwards .\\' \\' Stuff and nonsense !\\' said Alice loudly . \\' The idea of having the sentence first !\\' \\' Hold your tongue !\\' said the Queen , turning purple . \\' I won \\' t !\\' said Alice . \\' Off with her head !\\' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice . Nobody moved . \\' Who cares for you ?\\' said Alice , ( she had grown to her full size by this time .) \\' You \\' re nothing but a pack of cards !\\' At this the whole pack rose up into the air , and came flying down upon her : she gave a little scream , half of fright and half of anger , and tried to beat them off , and found herself lying on the bank , with her head in the lap of her sister , who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face . \\' Wake up , Alice dear !\\' said her sister ; \\' Why , what a long sleep you \\' ve had !\\' \\' Oh , I \\' ve had such a curious dream !\\' said Alice , and she told her sister , as well as she could remember them , all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about ; and when she had finished , her sister kissed her , and said , \\' It WAS a curious dream , dear , certainly : but now run in to your tea ; it \\' s getting late .\\' So Alice got up and ran off , thinking while she ran , as well she might , what a wonderful dream it had been . But her sister sat still just as she left her , leaning her head on her hand , watching the setting sun , and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures , till she too began dreaming after a fashion , and this was her dream :-- First , she dreamed of little Alice herself , and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee , and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers -- she could hear the very tones of her voice , and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes -- and still as she listened , or seemed to listen , the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister \\' s dream . The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by -- the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool -- she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared their never - ending meal , and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution -- once more the pig - baby was sneezing on the Duchess \\' s knee , while plates and dishes crashed around it -- once more the shriek of the Gryphon , the squeaking of the Lizard \\' s slate - pencil , and the choking of the suppressed guinea - pigs , filled the air , mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle . So she sat on , with closed eyes , and half believed herself in Wonderland , though she knew she had but to open them again , and all would change to dull reality -- the grass would be only rustling in the wind , and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds -- the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep - bells , and the Queen \\' s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy -- and the sneeze of the baby , the shriek of the Gryphon , and all the other queer noises , would change ( she knew ) to the confused clamour of the busy farm - yard -- while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle \\' s heavy sobs . Lastly , she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would , in the after - time , be herself a grown woman ; and how she would keep , through all her riper years , the simple and loving heart of her childhood : and how she would gather about her other little children , and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale , perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago : and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows , and find a pleasure in all their simple joys , remembering her own child - life , and the happy summer days .

       "' alice  s adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll   chapter i  down the rabbit  hole alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank  and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading  but it had no pictures or conversations in it   and what is the use of a book  thought alice  without pictures or conversation  so she was considering in her own mind  as well as she could  for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid  whether the pleasure of making a daisy  chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies  when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her  there was nothing so very remarkable in that  nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself   oh dear  oh dear  i shall be late   when she thought it over afterwards  it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this  but at the time it all seemed quite natural  but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat  pocket  and looked at it  and then hurried on  alice started to her feet  for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat  pocket  or a watch to take out of it  and burning with curiosity  she ran across the field after it  and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit  hole under the hedge  in another moment down went alice after it  never once considering how in the world she was to get out again  the rabbit  hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way  and then dipped suddenly down  so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well  either the well was very deep  or she fell very slowly  for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next  first  she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to  but it was too dark to see anything  then she looked at the sides of the well  and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book  shelves  here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs  she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed  it was labelled  orange marmalade  but to her great disappointment it was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody  so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it   well  thought alice to herself   after such a fall as this  i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs  how brave they  ll all think me at home  why  i wouldn  t say anything about it  even if i fell off the top of the house   which was very likely true  down  down  down  would the fall never come to an end   i wonder how many miles i  ve fallen by this time  she said aloud   i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth  let me see  that would be four thousand miles down  i think   for  you see  alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom  and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge  as there was no one to listen to her  still it was good practice to say it over   yes  that  s about the right distance  but then i wonder what latitude or longitude i  ve got to   alice had no idea what latitude was  or longitude either  but thought they were nice grand words to say  presently she began again   i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth  how funny it  ll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward  the antipathies  i think   she was rather glad there was no one listening  this time  as it didn  t sound at all the right word   but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is  you know  please  ma  am  is this new zealand or australia   and she tried to curtsey as she spoke  fancy curtseying as you  re falling through the air  do you think you could manage it   and what an ignorant little girl she  ll think me for asking  no  it  ll never do to ask  perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere  down  down  down  there was nothing else to do  so alice soon began talking again   dinah  ll miss me very much to  night  i should think   dinah was the cat   i hope they  ll remember her saucer of milk at tea  time  dinah my dear  i wish you were down here with me  there are no mice in the air  i  m afraid  but you might catch a bat  and that  s very like a mouse  you know  but do cats eat bats  i wonder  and here alice began to get rather sleepy  and went on saying to herself  in a dreamy sort of way   do cats eat bats  do cats eat bats  and sometimes   do bats eat cats  for  you see  as she couldn  t answer either question  it didn  t much matter which way she put it  she felt that she was dozing off  and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah  and saying to her very earnestly   now  dinah  tell me the truth  did you ever eat a bat  when suddenly  thump  thump  down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves  and the fall was over  alice was not a bit hurt  and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment  she looked up  but it was all dark overhead  before her was another long passage  and the white rabbit was still in sight  hurrying down it  there was not a moment to be lost  away went alice like the wind  and was just in time to hear it say  as it turned a corner   oh my ears and whiskers  how late it  s getting  she was close behind it when she turned the corner  but the rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found herself in a long  low hall  which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof  there were doors all round the hall  but they were all locked  and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other  trying every door  she walked sadly down the middle  wondering how she was ever to get out again  suddenly she came upon a little three  legged table  all made of solid glass  there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key  and alice  s first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall  but  alas  either the locks were too large  or the key was too small  but at any rate it would not open any of them  however  on the second time round  she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before  and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high  she tried the little golden key in the lock  and to her great delight it fitted  alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage  not much larger than a rat  hole  she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw  how she longed to get out of that dark hall  and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains  but she could not even get her head through the doorway   and even if my head would go through  thought poor alice   it would be of very little use without my shoulders  oh  how i wish i could shut up like a telescope  i think i could  if i only know how to begin  for  you see  so many out  of  the  way things had happened lately  that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible  there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door  so she went back to the table  half hoping she might find another key on it  or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes  this time she found a little bottle on it   which certainly was not here before  said alice  and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label  with the words  drink me  beautifully printed on it in large letters  it was all very well to say  drink me  but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry   no  i  ll look first  she said   and see whether it  s marked  poison  or not  for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt  and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things  all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them  such as  that a red  hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long  and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife  it usually bleeds  and she had never forgotten that  if you drink much from a bottle marked  poison  it is almost certain to disagree with you  sooner or later  however  this bottle was not marked  poison  so alice ventured to taste it  and finding it very nice   it had  in fact  a sort of mixed flavour of cherry  tart  custard  pine  apple  roast turkey  toffee  and hot buttered toast  she very soon finished it off                       what a curious feeling  said alice   i must be shutting up like a telescope  and so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high  and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden  first  however  she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further  she felt a little nervous about this   for it might end  you know  said alice to herself   in my going out altogether  like a candle  i wonder what i should be like then  and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out  for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing  after a while  finding that nothing more happened  she decided on going into the garden at once  but  alas for poor alice  when she got to the door  she found she had forgotten the little golden key  and when she went back to the table for it  she found she could not possibly reach it  she could see it quite plainly through the glass  and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table  but it was too slippery  and when she had tired herself out with trying  the poor little thing sat down and cried   come  there  s no use in crying like that  said alice to herself  rather sharply   i advise you to leave off this minute  she generally gave herself very good advice   though she very seldom followed it  and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes  and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself  for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people   but it  s no use now  thought poor alice   to pretend to be two people  why  there  s hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person  soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table  she opened it  and found in it a very small cake  on which the words  eat me  were beautifully marked in currants   well  i  ll eat it  said alice   and if it makes me grow larger  i can reach the key  and if it makes me grow smaller  i can creep under the door  so either way i  ll get into the garden  and i don  t care which happens  she ate a little bit  and said anxiously to herself   which way  which way  holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing  and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size  to be sure  this generally happens when one eats cake  but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out  of  the  way things to happen  that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way  so she set to work  and very soon finished off the cake                      chapter ii  the pool of tears  curiouser and curiouser  cried alice  she was so much surprised  that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english   now i  m opening out like the largest telescope that ever was  good  bye  feet   for when she looked down at her feet  they seemed to be almost out of sight  they were getting so far off   oh  my poor little feet  i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now  dears  i  m sure i shan  t be able  i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you  you must manage the best way you can  but i must be kind to them  thought alice   or perhaps they won  t walk the way i want to go  let me see  i  ll give them a new pair of boots every christmas  and she went on planning to herself how she would manage it   they must go by the carrier  she thought   and how funny it  ll seem  sending presents to one  s own feet  and how odd the directions will look  alice  s right foot  esq  hearthrug  near the fender   with alice  s love  oh dear  what nonsense i  m talking  just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in fact she was now more than nine feet high  and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door  poor alice  it was as much as she could do  lying down on one side  to look through into the garden with one eye  but to get through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to cry again   you ought to be ashamed of yourself  said alice   a great girl like you   she might well say this   to go on crying in this way  stop this moment  i tell you  but she went on all the same  shedding gallons of tears  until there was a large pool all round her  about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall  after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance  and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming  it was the white rabbit returning  splendidly dressed  with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other  he came trotting along in a great hurry  muttering to himself as he came   oh  the duchess  the duchess  oh  won  t she be savage if i  ve kept her waiting  alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one  so  when the rabbit came near her  she began  in a low  timid voice   if you please  sir  the rabbit started violently  dropped the white kid gloves and the fan  and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go  alice took up the fan and gloves  and  as the hall was very hot  she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking   dear  dear  how queer everything is to  day  and yesterday things went on just as usual  i wonder if i  ve been changed in the night  let me think  was i the same when i got up this morning  i almost think i can remember feeling a little different  but if i  m not the same  the next question is  who in the world am i  ah  that  s the great puzzle  and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself  to see if she could have been changed for any of them   i  m sure i  m not ada  she said   for her hair goes in such long ringlets  and mine doesn  t go in ringlets at all  and i  m sure i can  t be mabel  for i know all sorts of things  and she  oh  she knows such a very little  besides  she  s she  and i  m i  and  oh dear  how puzzling it all is  i  ll try if i know all the things i used to know  let me see  four times five is twelve  and four times six is thirteen  and four times seven is  oh dear  i shall never get to twenty at that rate  however  the multiplication table doesn  t signify  let  s try geography  london is the capital of paris  and paris is the capital of rome  and rome  no  that  s all wrong  i  m certain  i must have been changed for mabel  i  ll try and say  how doth the little  and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons  and began to repeat it  but her voice sounded hoarse and strange  and the words did not come the same as they used to do   how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail  and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale   how cheerfully he seems to grin  how neatly spread his claws  and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws   i  m sure those are not the right words  said poor alice  and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on   i must be mabel after all  and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house  and have next to no toys to play with  and oh  ever so many lessons to learn  no  i  ve made up my mind about it  if i  m mabel  i  ll stay down here  it  ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying  come up again  dear  i shall only look up and say  who am i then  tell me that first  and then  if i like being that person  i  ll come up  if not  i  ll stay down here till i  m somebody else  but  oh dear  cried alice  with a sudden burst of tears   i do wish they would put their heads down  i am so very tired of being all alone here  as she said this she looked down at her hands  and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbit  s little white kid gloves while she was talking   how can i have done that  she thought   i must be growing small again  she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it  and found that  as nearly as she could guess  she was now about two feet high  and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding  and she dropped it hastily  just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether   that was a narrow escape  said alice  a good deal frightened at the sudden change  but very glad to find herself still in existence   and now for the garden  and she ran with all speed back to the little door  but  alas  the little door was shut again  and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before   and things are worse than ever  thought the poor child   for i never was so small as this before  never  and i declare it  s too bad  that it is  as she said these words her foot slipped  and in another moment  splash  she was up to her chin in salt water  her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea   and in that case i can go back by railway  she said to herself   alice had been to the seaside once in her life  and had come to the general conclusion  that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea  some children digging in the sand with wooden spades  then a row of lodging houses  and behind them a railway station  however  she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high   i wish i hadn  t cried so much  said alice  as she swam about  trying to find her way out   i shall be punished for it now  i suppose  by being drowned in my own tears  that will be a queer thing  to be sure  however  everything is queer to  day  just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off  and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus  but then she remembered how small she was now  and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself   would it be of any use  now  thought alice   to speak to this mouse  everything is so out  of  the  way down here  that i should think very likely it can talk  at any rate  there  s no harm in trying  so she began   o mouse  do you know the way out of this pool  i am very tired of swimming about here  o mouse   alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse  she had never done such a thing before  but she remembered having seen in her brother  s latin grammar   a mouse  of a mouse  to a mouse  a mouse  o mouse  the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively  and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes  but it said nothing   perhaps it doesn  t understand english  thought alice   i daresay it  s a french mouse  come over with william the conqueror   for  with all her knowledge of history  alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened  so she began again   ou est ma chatte  which was the first sentence in her french lesson  book  the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water  and seemed to quiver all over with fright   oh  i beg your pardon  cried alice hastily  afraid that she had hurt the poor animal  s feelings   i quite forgot you didn  t like cats   not like cats  cried the mouse  in a shrill  passionate voice   would you like cats if you were me   well  perhaps not  said alice in a soothing tone   don  t be angry about it  and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah  i think you  d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her  she is such a dear quiet thing  alice went on  half to herself  as she swam lazily about in the pool   and she sits purring so nicely by the fire  licking her paws and washing her face  and she is such a nice soft thing to nurse  and she  s such a capital one for catching mice  oh  i beg your pardon  cried alice again  for this time the mouse was bristling all over  and she felt certain it must be really offended   we won  t talk about her any more if you  d rather not   we indeed  cried the mouse  who was trembling down to the end of his tail   as if i would talk on such a subject  our family always hated cats  nasty  low  vulgar things  don  t let me hear the name again   i won  t indeed  said alice  in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation   are you  are you fond  of  of dogs  the mouse did not answer  so alice went on eagerly   there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you  a little bright  eyed terrier  you know  with oh  such long curly brown hair  and it  ll fetch things when you throw them  and it  ll sit up and beg for its dinner  and all sorts of things  i can  t remember half of them  and it belongs to a farmer  you know  and he says it  s so useful  it  s worth a hundred pounds  he says it kills all the rats and  oh dear  cried alice in a sorrowful tone   i  m afraid i  ve offended it again  for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go  and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went  so she called softly after it   mouse dear  do come back again  and we won  t talk about cats or dogs either  if you don  t like them  when the mouse heard this  it turned round and swam slowly back to her  its face was quite pale  with passion  alice thought  and it said in a low trembling voice   let us get to the shore  and then i  ll tell you my history  and you  ll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs  it was high time to go  for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it  there were a duck and a dodo  a lory and an eaglet  and several other curious creatures  alice led the way  and the whole party swam to the shore  chapter iii  a caucus  race and a long tale they were indeed a queer  looking party that assembled on the bank  the birds with draggled feathers  the animals with their fur clinging close to them  and all dripping wet  cross  and uncomfortable  the first question of course was  how to get dry again  they had a consultation about this  and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them  as if she had known them all her life  indeed  she had quite a long argument with the lory  who at last turned sulky  and would only say   i am older than you  and must know better  and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was  and  as the lory positively refused to tell its age  there was no more to be said  at last the mouse  who seemed to be a person of authority among them  called out   sit down  all of you  and listen to me  i  ll soon make you dry enough  they all sat down at once  in a large ring  with the mouse in the middle  alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it  for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon   ahem  said the mouse with an important air   are you all ready  this is the driest thing i know  silence all round  if you please   william the conqueror  whose cause was favoured by the pope  was soon submitted to by the english  who wanted leaders  and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest  edwin and morcar  the earls of mercia and northumbria   ugh  said the lory  with a shiver   i beg your pardon  said the mouse  frowning  but very politely   did you speak   not i  said the lory hastily   i thought you did  said the mouse   i proceed   edwin and morcar  the earls of mercia and northumbria  declared for him  and even stigand  the patriotic archbishop of canterbury  found it advisable   found what  said the duck   found it  the mouse replied rather crossly   of course you know what  it  means   i know what  it  means well enough  when i find a thing  said the duck   it  s generally a frog or a worm  the question is  what did the archbishop find  the mouse did not notice this question  but hurriedly went on   found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown  william  s conduct at first was moderate  but the insolence of his normans  how are you getting on now  my dear  it continued  turning to alice as it spoke   as wet as ever  said alice in a melancholy tone   it doesn  t seem to dry me at all   in that case  said the dodo solemnly  rising to its feet   i move that the meeting adjourn  for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies   speak english  said the eaglet   i don  t know the meaning of half those long words  and  what  s more  i don  t believe you do either  and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile  some of the other birds tittered audibly   what i was going to say  said the dodo in an offended tone   was  that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucus  race   what is a caucus  race  said alice  not that she wanted much to know  but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak  and no one else seemed inclined to say anything   why  said the dodo   the best way to explain it is to do it   and  as you might like to try the thing yourself  some winter day  i will tell you how the dodo managed it  first it marked out a race  course  in a sort of circle   the exact shape doesn  t matter  it said  and then all the party were placed along the course  here and there  there was no  one  two  three  and away  but they began running when they liked  and left off when they liked  so that it was not easy to know when the race was over  however  when they had been running half an hour or so  and were quite dry again  the dodo suddenly called out  the race is over  and they all crowded round it  panting  and asking   but who has won  this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought  and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead  the position in which you usually see shakespeare  in the pictures of him  while the rest waited in silence  at last the dodo said   everybody has won  and all must have prizes   but who is to give the prizes  quite a chorus of voices asked   why  she  of course  said the dodo  pointing to alice with one finger  and the whole party at once crowded round her  calling out in a confused way   prizes  prizes  alice had no idea what to do  and in despair she put her hand in her pocket  and pulled out a box of comfits   luckily the salt water had not got into it  and handed them round as prizes  there was exactly one a  piece all round   but she must have a prize herself  you know  said the mouse   of course  the dodo replied very gravely   what else have you got in your pocket  he went on  turning to alice   only a thimble  said alice sadly   hand it over here  said the dodo  then they all crowded round her once more  while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble  saying  we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble  and  when it had finished this short speech  they all cheered  alice thought the whole thing very absurd  but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh  and  as she could not think of anything to say  she simply bowed  and took the thimble  looking as solemn as she could  the next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise and confusion  as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs  and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back  however  it was over at last  and they sat down again in a ring  and begged the mouse to tell them something more   you promised to tell me your history  you know  said alice   and why it is you hate  c and d  she added in a whisper  half afraid that it would be offended again   mine is a long and a sad tale  said the mouse  turning to alice  and sighing   it is a long tail  certainly  said alice  looking down with wonder at the mouse  s tail   but why do you call it sad  and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking  so that her idea of the tale was something like this   fury said to a mouse  that he met in the house   let us both go to law  i will prosecute you  come  i  ll take no denial  we must have a trial  for really this morning i  ve nothing to do  said the mouse to the cur   such a trial  dear sir  with no jury or judge  would be wasting our breath   i  ll be judge  i  ll be jury  said cunning old fury   i  ll try the whole cause  and condemn you to death   you are not attending  said the mouse to alice severely   what are you thinking of   i beg your pardon  said alice very humbly   you had got to the fifth bend  i think   i had not  cried the mouse  sharply and very angrily   a knot  said alice  always ready to make herself useful  and looking anxiously about her   oh  do let me help to undo it   i shall do nothing of the sort  said the mouse  getting up and walking away   you insult me by talking such nonsense   i didn  t mean it  pleaded poor alice   but you  re so easily offended  you know  the mouse only growled in reply   please come back and finish your story  alice called after it  and the others all joined in chorus   yes  please do  but the mouse only shook its head impatiently  and walked a little quicker   what a pity it wouldn  t stay  sighed the lory  as soon as it was quite out of sight  and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter  ah  my dear  let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper   hold your tongue  ma  said the young crab  a little snappishly   you  re enough to try the patience of an oyster   i wish i had our dinah here  i know i do  said alice aloud  addressing nobody in particular   she  d soon fetch it back   and who is dinah  if i might venture to ask the question  said the lory  alice replied eagerly  for she was always ready to talk about her pet   dinah  s our cat  and she  s such a capital one for catching mice you can  t think  and oh  i wish you could see her after the birds  why  she  ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it  this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party  some of the birds hurried off at once  one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully  remarking   i really must be getting home  the night  air doesn  t suit my throat  and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children   come away  my dears  it  s high time you were all in bed  on various pretexts they all moved off  and alice was soon left alone   i wish i hadn  t mentioned dinah  she said to herself in a melancholy tone   nobody seems to like her  down here  and i  m sure she  s the best cat in the world  oh  my dear dinah  i wonder if i shall ever see you any more  and here poor alice began to cry again  for she felt very lonely and low  spirited  in a little while  however  she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance  and she looked up eagerly  half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind  and was coming back to finish his story  chapter iv  the rabbit sends in a little bill it was the white rabbit  trotting slowly back again  and looking anxiously about as it went  as if it had lost something  and she heard it muttering to itself  the duchess  the duchess  oh my dear paws  oh my fur and whiskers  she  ll get me executed  as sure as ferrets are ferrets  where can i have dropped them  i wonder  alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves  and she very good  naturedly began hunting about for them  but they were nowhere to be seen  everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool  and the great hall  with the glass table and the little door  had vanished completely  very soon the rabbit noticed alice  as she went hunting about  and called out to her in an angry tone   why  mary ann  what are you doing out here  run home this moment  and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan  quick  now  and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to  without trying to explain the mistake it had made   he took me for his housemaid  she said to herself as she ran   how surprised he  ll be when he finds out who i am  but i  d better take him his fan and gloves  that is  if i can find them  as she said this  she came upon a neat little house  on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name  w  rabbit  engraved upon it  she went in without knocking  and hurried upstairs  in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann  and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves   how queer it seems  alice said to herself   to be going messages for a rabbit  i suppose dinah  ll be sending me on messages next  and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen   miss alice  come here directly  and get ready for your walk   coming in a minute  nurse  but i  ve got to see that the mouse doesn  t get out  only i don  t think  alice went on   that they  d let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that  by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window  and on it  as she had hoped  a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves  she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves  and was just going to leave the room  when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking  glass  there was no label this time with the words  drink me  but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips   i know something interesting is sure to happen  she said to herself   whenever i eat or drink anything  so i  ll just see what this bottle does  i do hope it  ll make me grow large again  for really i  m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing  it did so indeed  and much sooner than she had expected  before she had drunk half the bottle  she found her head pressing against the ceiling  and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken  she hastily put down the bottle  saying to herself  that  s quite enough  i hope i shan  t grow any more  as it is  i can  t get out at the door  i do wish i hadn  t drunk quite so much  alas  it was too late to wish that  she went on growing  and growing  and very soon had to kneel down on the floor  in another minute there was not even room for this  and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door  and the other arm curled round her head  still she went on growing  and  as a last resource  she put one arm out of the window  and one foot up the chimney  and said to herself  now i can do no more  whatever happens  what will become of me  luckily for alice  the little magic bottle had now had its full effect  and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable  and  as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again  no wonder she felt unhappy   it was much pleasanter at home  thought poor alice   when one wasn  t always growing larger and smaller  and being ordered about by mice and rabbits  i almost wish i hadn  t gone down that rabbit  hole  and yet  and yet  it  s rather curious  you know  this sort of life  i do wonder what can have happened to me  when i used to read fairy  tales  i fancied that kind of thing never happened  and now here i am in the middle of one  there ought to be a book written about me  that there ought  and when i grow up  i  ll write one  but i  m grown up now  she added in a sorrowful tone   at least there  s no room to grow up any more here   but then  thought alice   shall i never get any older than i am now  that  ll be a comfort  one way  never to be an old woman  but then  always to have lessons to learn  oh  i shouldn  t like that   oh  you foolish alice  she answered herself   how can you learn lessons in here  why  there  s hardly room for you  and no room at all for any lesson  books  and so she went on  taking first one side and then the other  and making quite a conversation of it altogether  but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside  and stopped to listen   mary ann  mary ann  said the voice   fetch me my gloves this moment  then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs  alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her  and she trembled till she shook the house  quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit  and had no reason to be afraid of it  presently the rabbit came up to the door  and tried to open it  but  as the door opened inwards  and alice  s elbow was pressed hard against it  that attempt proved a failure  alice heard it say to itself  then i  ll go round and get in at the window   that you won  t  thought alice  and  after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window  she suddenly spread out her hand  and made a snatch in the air  she did not get hold of anything  but she heard a little shriek and a fall  and a crash of broken glass  from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber  frame  or something of the sort  next came an angry voice  the rabbit  s  pat  pat  where are you  and then a voice she had never heard before   sure then i  m here  digging for apples  yer honour   digging for apples  indeed  said the rabbit angrily   here  come and help me out of this   sounds of more broken glass   now tell me  pat  what  s that in the window   sure  it  s an arm  yer honour   he pronounced it  arrum   an arm  you goose  who ever saw one that size  why  it fills the whole window   sure  it does  yer honour  but it  s an arm for all that   well  it  s got no business there  at any rate  go and take it away  there was a long silence after this  and alice could only hear whispers now and then  such as   sure  i don  t like it  yer honour  at all  at all   do as i tell you  you coward  and at last she spread out her hand again  and made another snatch in the air  this time there were two little shrieks  and more sounds of broken glass   what a number of cucumber  frames there must be  thought alice   i wonder what they  ll do next  as for pulling me out of the window  i only wish they could  i  m sure i don  t want to stay in here any longer  she waited for some time without hearing anything more  at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels  and the sound of a good many voices all talking together  she made out the words   where  s the other ladder  why  i hadn  t to bring but one  bill  s got the other  bill  fetch it here  lad  here  put  em up at this corner  no  tie  em together first  they don  t reach half high enough yet  oh  they  ll do well enough  don  t be particular  here  bill  catch hold of this rope  will the roof bear  mind that loose slate  oh  it  s coming down  heads below   a loud crash  now  who did that  it was bill  i fancy  who  s to go down the chimney  nay  i shan  t  you do it  that i won  t  then  bill  s to go down  here  bill  the master says you  re to go down the chimney   oh  so bill  s got to come down the chimney  has he  said alice to herself   shy  they seem to put everything upon bill  i wouldn  t be in bill  s place for a good deal  this fireplace is narrow  to be sure  but i think i can kick a little  she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could  and waited till she heard a little animal  she couldn  t guess of what sort it was  scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her  then  saying to herself  this is bill  she gave one sharp kick  and waited to see what would happen next  the first thing she heard was a general chorus of  there goes bill  then the rabbit  s voice along  catch him  you by the hedge  then silence  and then another confusion of voices  hold up his head  brandy now  don  t choke him  how was it  old fellow  what happened to you  tell us all about it  last came a little feeble  squeaking voice   that  s bill  thought alice   well  i hardly know  no more  thank ye  i  m better now  but i  m a deal too flustered to tell you  all i know is  something comes at me like a jack  in  the  box  and up i goes like a sky  rocket   so you did  old fellow  said the others   we must burn the house down  said the rabbit  s voice  and alice called out as loud as she could   if you do  i  ll set dinah at you  there was a dead silence instantly  and alice thought to herself   i wonder what they will do next  if they had any sense  they  d take the roof off  after a minute or two  they began moving about again  and alice heard the rabbit say   a barrowful will do  to begin with   a barrowful of what  thought alice  but she had not long to doubt  for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window  and some of them hit her in the face   i  ll put a stop to this  she said to herself  and shouted out   you  d better not do that again  which produced another dead silence  alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor  and a bright idea came into her head   if i eat one of these cakes  she thought   it  s sure to make some change in my size  and as it can  t possibly make me larger  it must make me smaller  i suppose  so she swallowed one of the cakes  and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly  as soon as she was small enough to get through the door  she ran out of the house  and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside  the poor little lizard  bill  was in the middle  being held up by two guinea  pigs  who were giving it something out of a bottle  they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared  but she ran off as hard as she could  and soon found herself safe in a thick wood   the first thing i  ve got to do  said alice to herself  as she wandered about in the wood   is to grow to my right size again  and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden  i think that will be the best plan  it sounded an excellent plan  no doubt  and very neatly and simply arranged  the only difficulty was  that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it  and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees  a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry  an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes  and feebly stretching out one paw  trying to touch her   poor little thing  said alice  in a coaxing tone  and she tried hard to whistle to it  but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry  in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing  hardly knowing what she did  she picked up a little bit of stick  and held it out to the puppy  whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once  with a yelp of delight  and rushed at the stick  and made believe to worry it  then alice dodged behind a great thistle  to keep herself from being run over  and the moment she appeared on the other side  the puppy made another rush at the stick  and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it  then alice  thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart  horse  and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet  ran round the thistle again  then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick  running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back  and barking hoarsely all the while  till at last it sat down a good way off  panting  with its tongue hanging out of its mouth  and its great eyes half shut  this seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape  so she set off at once  and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath  and till the puppy  s bark sounded quite faint in the distance   and yet what a dear little puppy it was  said alice  as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself  and fanned herself with one of the leaves   i should have liked teaching it tricks very much  if  if i  d only been the right size to do it  oh dear  i  d nearly forgotten that i  ve got to grow up again  let me see  how is it to be managed  i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other  but the great question is  what  the great question certainly was  what  alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass  but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances  there was a large mushroom growing near her  about the same height as herself  and when she had looked under it  and on both sides of it  and behind it  it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it  she stretched herself up on tiptoe  and peeped over the edge of the mushroom  and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar  that was sitting on the top with its arms folded  quietly smoking a long hookah  and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else  chapter v  advice from a caterpillar the caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence  at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth  and addressed her in a languid  sleepy voice   who are you  said the caterpillar  this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  alice replied  rather shyly   i  i hardly know  sir  just at present  at least i know who i was when i got up this morning  but i think i must have been changed several times since then   what do you mean by that  said the caterpillar sternly   explain yourself   i can  t explain myself  i  m afraid  sir  said alice   because i  m not myself  you see   i don  t see  said the caterpillar   i  m afraid i can  t put it more clearly  alice replied very politely   for i can  t understand it myself to begin with  and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing   it isn  t  said the caterpillar   well  perhaps you haven  t found it so yet  said alice   but when you have to turn into a chrysalis  you will some day  you know  and then after that into a butterfly  i should think you  ll feel it a little queer  won  t you   not a bit  said the caterpillar   well  perhaps your feelings may be different  said alice   all i know is  it would feel very queer to me   you  said the caterpillar contemptuously   who are you  which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation  alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillar  s making such very short remarks  and she drew herself up and said  very gravely   i think  you ought to tell me who you are  first   why  said the caterpillar  here was another puzzling question  and as alice could not think of any good reason  and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind  she turned away   come back  the caterpillar called after her   i  ve something important to say  this sounded promising  certainly  alice turned and came back again   keep your temper  said the caterpillar   is that all  said alice  swallowing down her anger as well as she could   no  said the caterpillar  alice thought she might as well wait  as she had nothing else to do  and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing  for some minutes it puffed away without speaking  but at last it unfolded its arms  took the hookah out of its mouth again  and said   so you think you  re changed  do you   i  m afraid i am  sir  said alice   i can  t remember things as i used  and i don  t keep the same size for ten minutes together   can  t remember what things  said the caterpillar   well  i  ve tried to say  how doth the little busy bee  but it all came different  alice replied in a very melancholy voice   repeat   you are old  father william  said the caterpillar  alice folded her hands  and began   you are old  father william  the young man said   and your hair has become very white  and yet you incessantly stand on your head  do you think  at your age  it is right   in my youth  father william replied to his son   i feared it might injure the brain  but  now that i  m perfectly sure i have none  why  i do it again and again   you are old  said the youth   as i mentioned before  and have grown most uncommonly fat  yet you turned a back  somersault in at the door  pray  what is the reason of that   in my youth  said the sage  as he shook his grey locks   i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointment  one shilling the box  allow me to sell you a couple   you are old  said the youth   and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet  yet you finished the goose  with the bones and the beak  pray how did you manage to do it   in my youth  said his father   i took to the law  and argued each case with my wife  and the muscular strength  which it gave to my jaw  has lasted the rest of my life   you are old  said the youth   one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever  yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose  what made you so awfully clever   i have answered three questions  and that is enough  said his father   don  t give yourself airs  do you think i can listen all day to such stuff  be off  or i  ll kick you down stairs   that is not said right  said the caterpillar   not quite right  i  m afraid  said alice  timidly   some of the words have got altered   it is wrong from beginning to end  said the caterpillar decidedly  and there was silence for some minutes  the caterpillar was the first to speak   what size do you want to be  it asked   oh  i  m not particular as to size  alice hastily replied   only one doesn  t like changing so often  you know   i don  t know  said the caterpillar  alice said nothing  she had never been so much contradicted in her life before  and she felt that she was losing her temper   are you content now  said the caterpillar   well  i should like to be a little larger  sir  if you wouldn  t mind  said alice   three inches is such a wretched height to be   it is a very good height indeed  said the caterpillar angrily  rearing itself upright as it spoke  it was exactly three inches high   but i  m not used to it  pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone  and she thought of herself   i wish the creatures wouldn  t be so easily offended   you  ll get used to it in time  said the caterpillar  and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again  this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again  in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice  and shook itself  then it got down off the mushroom  and crawled away in the grass  merely remarking as it went   one side will make you grow taller  and the other side will make you grow shorter   one side of what  the other side of what  thought alice to herself   of the mushroom  said the caterpillar  just as if she had asked it aloud  and in another moment it was out of sight  alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute  trying to make out which were the two sides of it  and as it was perfectly round  she found this a very difficult question  however  at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go  and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand   and now which is which  she said to herself  and nibbled a little of the right  hand bit to try the effect  the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her foot  she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change  but she felt that there was no time to be lost  as she was shrinking rapidly  so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit  her chin was pressed so closely against her foot  that there was hardly room to open her mouth  but she did it at last  and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit                       come  my head  s free at last  said alice in a tone of delight  which changed into alarm in another moment  when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found  all she could see  when she looked down  was an immense length of neck  which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her   what can all that green stuff be  said alice   and where have my shoulders got to  and oh  my poor hands  how is it i can  t see you  she was moving them about as she spoke  but no result seemed to follow  except a little shaking among the distant green leaves  as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head  she tried to get her head down to them  and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction  like a serpent  she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag  and was going to dive in among the leaves  which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering  when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry  a large pigeon had flown into her face  and was beating her violently with its wings   serpent  screamed the pigeon   i  m not a serpent  said alice indignantly   let me alone   serpent  i say again  repeated the pigeon  but in a more subdued tone  and added with a kind of sob   i  ve tried every way  and nothing seems to suit them   i haven  t the least idea what you  re talking about  said alice   i  ve tried the roots of trees  and i  ve tried banks  and i  ve tried hedges  the pigeon went on  without attending to her   but those serpents  there  s no pleasing them  alice was more and more puzzled  but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finished   as if it wasn  t trouble enough hatching the eggs  said the pigeon   but i must be on the look  out for serpents night and day  why  i haven  t had a wink of sleep these three weeks   i  m very sorry you  ve been annoyed  said alice  who was beginning to see its meaning   and just as i  d taken the highest tree in the wood  continued the pigeon  raising its voice to a shriek   and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last  they must needs come wriggling down from the sky  ugh  serpent   but i  m not a serpent  i tell you  said alice   i  m a  i  m a   well  what are you  said the pigeon   i can see you  re trying to invent something   i  i  m a little girl  said alice  rather doubtfully  as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day   a likely story indeed  said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt   i  ve seen a good many little girls in my time  but never one with such a neck as that  no  no  you  re a serpent  and there  s no use denying it  i suppose you  ll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg   i have tasted eggs  certainly  said alice  who was a very truthful child   but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do  you know   i don  t believe it  said the pigeon   but if they do  why then they  re a kind of serpent  that  s all i can say  this was such a new idea to alice  that she was quite silent for a minute or two  which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding   you  re looking for eggs  i know that well enough  and what does it matter to me whether you  re a little girl or a serpent   it matters a good deal to me  said alice hastily   but i  m not looking for eggs  as it happens  and if i was  i shouldn  t want yours  i don  t like them raw   well  be off  then  said the pigeon in a sulky tone  as it settled down again into its nest  alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could  for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches  and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it  after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands  and she set to work very carefully  nibbling first at one and then at the other  and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter  until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height  it was so long since she had been anything near the right size  that it felt quite strange at first  but she got used to it in a few minutes  and began talking to herself  as usual   come  there  s half my plan done now  how puzzling all these changes are  i  m never sure what i  m going to be  from one minute to another  however  i  ve got back to my right size  the next thing is  to get into that beautiful garden  how is that to be done  i wonder  as she said this  she came suddenly upon an open place  with a little house in it about four feet high   whoever lives there  thought alice   it  ll never do to come upon them this size  why  i should frighten them out of their wits  so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again  and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high  chapter vi  pig and pepper for a minute or two she stood looking at the house  and wondering what to do next  when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood  she considered him to be a footman because he was in livery  otherwise  judging by his face only  she would have called him a fish  and rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles  it was opened by another footman in livery  with a round face  and large eyes like a frog  and both footmen  alice noticed  had powdered hair that curled all over their heads  she felt very curious to know what it was all about  and crept a little way out of the wood to listen  the fish  footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter  nearly as large as himself  and this he handed over to the other  saying  in a solemn tone   for the duchess  an invitation from the queen to play croquet  the frog  footman repeated  in the same solemn tone  only changing the order of the words a little   from the queen  an invitation for the duchess to play croquet  then they both bowed low  and their curls got entangled together  alice laughed so much at this  that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her  and when she next peeped out the fish  footman was gone  and the other was sitting on the ground near the door  staring stupidly up into the sky  alice went timidly up to the door  and knocked   there  s no sort of use in knocking  said the footman   and that for two reasons  first  because i  m on the same side of the door as you are  secondly  because they  re making such a noise inside  no one could possibly hear you  and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within  a constant howling and sneezing  and every now and then a great crash  as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces   please  then  said alice   how am i to get in   there might be some sense in your knocking  the footman went on without attending to her   if we had the door between us  for instance  if you were inside  you might knock  and i could let you out  you know  he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking  and this alice thought decidedly uncivil   but perhaps he can  t help it  she said to herself   his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head  but at any rate he might answer questions  how am i to get in  she repeated  aloud   i shall sit here  the footman remarked   till tomorrow  at this moment the door of the house opened  and a large plate came skimming out  straight at the footman  s head  it just grazed his nose  and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him   or next day  maybe  the footman continued in the same tone  exactly as if nothing had happened   how am i to get in  asked alice again  in a louder tone   are you to get in at all  said the footman   that  s the first question  you know  it was  no doubt  only alice did not like to be told so   it  s really dreadful  she muttered to herself   the way all the creatures argue  it  s enough to drive one crazy  the footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark  with variations   i shall sit here  he said   on and off  for days and days   but what am i to do  said alice   anything you like  said the footman  and began whistling   oh  there  s no use in talking to him  said alice desperately   he  s perfectly idiotic  and she opened the door and went in  the door led right into a large kitchen  which was full of smoke from one end to the other  the duchess was sitting on a three  legged stool in the middle  nursing a baby  the cook was leaning over the fire  stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup   there  s certainly too much pepper in that soup  alice said to herself  as well as she could for sneezing  there was certainly too much of it in the air  even the duchess sneezed occasionally  and as for the baby  it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment  s pause  the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze  were the cook  and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear   please would you tell me  said alice  a little timidly  for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first   why your cat grins like that   it  s a cheshire cat  said the duchess   and that  s why  pig  she said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped  but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby  and not to her  so she took courage  and went on again   i didn  t know that cheshire cats always grinned  in fact  i didn  t know that cats could grin   they all can  said the duchess   and most of  em do   i don  t know of any that do  alice said very politely  feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation   you don  t know much  said the duchess   and that  s a fact  alice did not at all like the tone of this remark  and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation  while she was trying to fix on one  the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire  and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby  the fire  irons came first  then followed a shower of saucepans  plates  and dishes  the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her  and the baby was howling so much already  that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not   oh  please mind what you  re doing  cried alice  jumping up and down in an agony of terror   oh  there goes his precious nose  as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it  and very nearly carried it off   if everybody minded their own business  the duchess said in a hoarse growl   the world would go round a deal faster than it does   which would not be an advantage  said alice  who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge   just think of what work it would make with the day and night  you see the earth takes twenty  four hours to turn round on its axis   talking of axes  said the duchess   chop off her head  alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook  to see if she meant to take the hint  but the cook was busily stirring the soup  and seemed not to be listening  so she went on again   twenty  four hours  i think  or is it twelve  i   oh  don  t bother me  said the duchess   i never could abide figures  and with that she began nursing her child again  singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so  and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line   speak roughly to your little boy  and beat him when he sneezes  he only does it to annoy  because he knows it teases  chorus   in which the cook and the baby joined   wow  wow  wow  while the duchess sang the second verse of the song  she kept tossing the baby violently up and down  and the poor little thing howled so  that alice could hardly hear the words   i speak severely to my boy  i beat him when he sneezes  for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases  chorus   wow  wow  wow   here  you may nurse it a bit  if you like  the duchess said to alice  flinging the baby at her as she spoke   i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen  and she hurried out of the room  the cook threw a frying  pan after her as she went out  but it just missed her  alice caught the baby with some difficulty  as it was a queer  shaped little creature  and held out its arms and legs in all directions   just like a star  fish  thought alice  the poor little thing was snorting like a steam  engine when she caught it  and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again  so that altogether  for the first minute or two  it was as much as she could do to hold it  as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it   which was to twist it up into a sort of knot  and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot  so as to prevent its undoing itself  she carried it out into the open air   if i don  t take this child away with me  thought alice   they  re sure to kill it in a day or two  wouldn  t it be murder to leave it behind  she said the last words out loud  and the little thing grunted in reply  it had left off sneezing by this time   don  t grunt  said alice   that  s not at all a proper way of expressing yourself  the baby grunted again  and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it  there could be no doubt that it had a very turn  up nose  much more like a snout than a real nose  also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby  altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all   but perhaps it was only sobbing  she thought  and looked into its eyes again  to see if there were any tears  no  there were no tears   if you  re going to turn into a pig  my dear  said alice  seriously   i  ll have nothing more to do with you  mind now  the poor little thing sobbed again  or grunted  it was impossible to say which  and they went on for some while in silence  alice was just beginning to think to herself   now  what am i to do with this creature when i get it home  when it grunted again  so violently  that she looked down into its face in some alarm  this time there could be no mistake about it  it was neither more nor less than a pig  and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further  so she set the little creature down  and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood   if it had grown up  she said to herself   it would have made a dreadfully ugly child  but it makes rather a handsome pig  i think  and she began thinking over other children she knew  who might do very well as pigs  and was just saying to herself   if one only knew the right way to change them  when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off  the cat only grinned when it saw alice  it looked good  natured  she thought  still it had very long claws and a great many teeth  so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect   cheshire puss  she began  rather timidly  as she did not at all know whether it would like the name  however  it only grinned a little wider   come  it  s pleased so far  thought alice  and she went on   would you tell me  please  which way i ought to go from here   that depends a good deal on where you want to get to  said the cat   i don  t much care where  said alice   then it doesn  t matter which way you go  said the cat   so long as i get somewhere  alice added as an explanation   oh  you  re sure to do that  said the cat   if you only walk long enough  alice felt that this could not be denied  so she tried another question   what sort of people live about here   in that direction  the cat said  waving its right paw round   lives a hatter  and in that direction  waving the other paw   lives a march hare  visit either you like  they  re both mad   but i don  t want to go among mad people  alice remarked   oh  you can  t help that  said the cat   we  re all mad here  i  m mad  you  re mad   how do you know i  m mad  said alice   you must be  said the cat   or you wouldn  t have come here  alice didn  t think that proved it at all  however  she went on  and how do you know that you  re mad   to begin with  said the cat   a dog  s not mad  you grant that   i suppose so  said alice   well  then  the cat went on   you see  a dog growls when it  s angry  and wags its tail when it  s pleased  now i growl when i  m pleased  and wag my tail when i  m angry  therefore i  m mad   i call it purring  not growling  said alice   call it what you like  said the cat   do you play croquet with the queen to  day   i should like it very much  said alice   but i haven  t been invited yet   you  ll see me there  said the cat  and vanished  alice was not much surprised at this  she was getting so used to queer things happening  while she was looking at the place where it had been  it suddenly appeared again   by  the  bye  what became of the baby  said the cat   i  d nearly forgotten to ask   it turned into a pig  alice quietly said  just as if it had come back in a natural way   i thought it would  said the cat  and vanished again  alice waited a little  half expecting to see it again  but it did not appear  and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live   i  ve seen hatters before  she said to herself   the march hare will be much the most interesting  and perhaps as this is may it won  t be raving mad  at least not so mad as it was in march  as she said this  she looked up  and there was the cat again  sitting on a branch of a tree   did you say pig  or fig  said the cat   i said pig  replied alice   and i wish you wouldn  t keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy   all right  said the cat  and this time it vanished quite slowly  beginning with the end of the tail  and ending with the grin  which remained some time after the rest of it had gone   well  i  ve often seen a cat without a grin  thought alice   but a grin without a cat  it  s the most curious thing i ever saw in my life  she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare  she thought it must be the right house  because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur  it was so large a house  that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom  and raised herself to about two feet high  even then she walked up towards it rather timidly  saying to herself  suppose it should be raving mad after all  i almost wish i  d gone to see the hatter instead  chapter vii  a mad tea  party there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house  and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it  a dormouse was sitting between them  fast asleep  and the other two were using it as a cushion  resting their elbows on it  and talking over its head   very uncomfortable for the dormouse  thought alice   only  as it  s asleep  i suppose it doesn  t mind  the table was a large one  but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it   no room  no room  they cried out when they saw alice coming   there  s plenty of room  said alice indignantly  and she sat down in a large arm  chair at one end of the table   have some wine  the march hare said in an encouraging tone  alice looked all round the table  but there was nothing on it but tea   i don  t see any wine  she remarked   there isn  t any  said the march hare   then it wasn  t very civil of you to offer it  said alice angrily   it wasn  t very civil of you to sit down without being invited  said the march hare   i didn  t know it was your table  said alice   it  s laid for a great many more than three   your hair wants cutting  said the hatter  he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity  and this was his first speech   you should learn not to make personal remarks  alice said with some severity   it  s very rude  the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this  but all he said was   why is a raven like a writing  desk   come  we shall have some fun now  thought alice   i  m glad they  ve begun asking riddles  i believe i can guess that  she added aloud   do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it  said the march hare   exactly so  said alice   then you should say what you mean  the march hare went on   i do  alice hastily replied   at least  at least i mean what i say  that  s the same thing  you know   not the same thing a bit  said the hatter   you might just as well say that  i see what i eat  is the same thing as  i eat what i see   you might just as well say  added the march hare   that  i like what i get  is the same thing as  i get what i like   you might just as well say  added the dormouse  who seemed to be talking in his sleep   that  i breathe when i sleep  is the same thing as  i sleep when i breathe   it is the same thing with you  said the hatter  and here the conversation dropped  and the party sat silent for a minute  while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing  desks  which wasn  t much  the hatter was the first to break the silence   what day of the month is it  he said  turning to alice  he had taken his watch out of his pocket  and was looking at it uneasily  shaking it every now and then  and holding it to his ear  alice considered a little  and then said  the fourth   two days wrong  sighed the hatter   i told you butter wouldn  t suit the works  he added looking angrily at the march hare   it was the best butter  the march hare meekly replied   yes  but some crumbs must have got in as well  the hatter grumbled   you shouldn  t have put it in with the bread  knife  the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then he dipped it into his cup of tea  and looked at it again  but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark   it was the best butter  you know  alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity   what a funny watch  she remarked   it tells the day of the month  and doesn  t tell what o  clock it is   why should it  muttered the hatter   does your watch tell you what year it is   of course not  alice replied very readily   but that  s because it stays the same year for such a long time together   which is just the case with mine  said the hatter  alice felt dreadfully puzzled  the hatter  s remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it  and yet it was certainly english   i don  t quite understand you  she said  as politely as she could   the dormouse is asleep again  said the hatter  and he poured a little hot tea upon its nose  the dormouse shook its head impatiently  and said  without opening its eyes   of course  of course  just what i was going to remark myself   have you guessed the riddle yet  the hatter said  turning to alice again   no  i give it up  alice replied   what  s the answer   i haven  t the slightest idea  said the hatter   nor i  said the march hare  alice sighed wearily   i think you might do something better with the time  she said   than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers   if you knew time as well as i do  said the hatter   you wouldn  t talk about wasting it  it  s him   i don  t know what you mean  said alice   of course you don  t  the hatter said  tossing his head contemptuously   i dare say you never even spoke to time   perhaps not  alice cautiously replied   but i know i have to beat time when i learn music   ah  that accounts for it  said the hatter   he won  t stand beating  now  if you only kept on good terms with him  he  d do almost anything you liked with the clock  for instance  suppose it were nine o  clock in the morning  just time to begin lessons  you  d only have to whisper a hint to time  and round goes the clock in a twinkling  half  past one  time for dinner   i only wish it was  the march hare said to itself in a whisper   that would be grand  certainly  said alice thoughtfully   but then  i shouldn  t be hungry for it  you know   not at first  perhaps  said the hatter   but you could keep it to half  past one as long as you liked   is that the way you manage  alice asked  the hatter shook his head mournfully   not i  he replied   we quarrelled last march  just before he went mad  you know   pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare   it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts  and i had to sing  twinkle  twinkle  little bat  how i wonder what you  re at  you know the song  perhaps   i  ve heard something like it  said alice   it goes on  you know  the hatter continued   in this way   up above the world you fly  like a tea  tray in the sky  twinkle  twinkle  here the dormouse shook itself  and began singing in its sleep  twinkle  twinkle  twinkle  twinkle  and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop   well  i  d hardly finished the first verse  said the hatter   when the queen jumped up and bawled out   he  s murdering the time  off with his head   how dreadfully savage  exclaimed alice   and ever since that  the hatter went on in a mournful tone   he won  t do a thing i ask  it  s always six o  clock now  a bright idea came into alice  s head   is that the reason so many tea  things are put out here  she asked   yes  that  s it  said the hatter with a sigh   it  s always tea  time  and we  ve no time to wash the things between whiles   then you keep moving round  i suppose  said alice   exactly so  said the hatter   as the things get used up   but what happens when you come to the beginning again  alice ventured to ask   suppose we change the subject  the march hare interrupted  yawning   i  m getting tired of this  i vote the young lady tells us a story   i  m afraid i don  t know one  said alice  rather alarmed at the proposal   then the dormouse shall  they both cried   wake up  dormouse  and they pinched it on both sides at once  the dormouse slowly opened his eyes   i wasn  t asleep  he said in a hoarse  feeble voice   i heard every word you fellows were saying   tell us a story  said the march hare   yes  please do  pleaded alice   and be quick about it  added the hatter   or you  ll be asleep again before it  s done   once upon a time there were three little sisters  the dormouse began in a great hurry   and their names were elsie  lacie  and tillie  and they lived at the bottom of a well   what did they live on  said alice  who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking   they lived on treacle  said the dormouse  after thinking a minute or two   they couldn  t have done that  you know  alice gently remarked   they  d have been ill   so they were  said the dormouse   very ill  alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like  but it puzzled her too much  so she went on   but why did they live at the bottom of a well   take some more tea  the march hare said to alice  very earnestly   i  ve had nothing yet  alice replied in an offended tone   so i can  t take more   you mean you can  t take less  said the hatter   it  s very easy to take more than nothing   nobody asked your opinion  said alice   who  s making personal remarks now  the hatter asked triumphantly  alice did not quite know what to say to this  so she helped herself to some tea and bread  and  butter  and then turned to the dormouse  and repeated her question   why did they live at the bottom of a well  the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it  and then said   it was a treacle  well   there  s no such thing  alice was beginning very angrily  but the hatter and the march hare went  sh  sh  and the dormouse sulkily remarked   if you can  t be civil  you  d better finish the story for yourself   no  please go on  alice said very humbly   i won  t interrupt again  i dare say there may be one   one  indeed  said the dormouse indignantly  however  he consented to go on   and so these three little sisters  they were learning to draw  you know   what did they draw  said alice  quite forgetting her promise   treacle  said the dormouse  without considering at all this time   i want a clean cup  interrupted the hatter   let  s all move one place on  he moved on as he spoke  and the dormouse followed him  the march hare moved into the dormouse  s place  and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare  the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change  and alice was a good deal worse off than before  as the march hare had just upset the milk  jug into his plate  alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again  so she began very cautiously   but i don  t understand  where did they draw the treacle from   you can draw water out of a water  well  said the hatter   so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle  well  eh  stupid   but they were in the well  alice said to the dormouse  not choosing to notice this last remark   of course they were  said the dormouse   well in  this answer so confused poor alice  that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it   they were learning to draw  the dormouse went on  yawning and rubbing its eyes  for it was getting very sleepy   and they drew all manner of things  everything that begins with an m   why with an m  said alice   why not  said the march hare  alice was silent  the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time  and was going off into a doze  but  on being pinched by the hatter  it woke up again with a little shriek  and went on   that begins with an m  such as mouse  traps  and the moon  and memory  and muchness  you know you say things are  much of a muchness  did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness   really  now you ask me  said alice  very much confused   i don  t think   then you shouldn  t talk  said the hatter  this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear  she got up in great disgust  and walked off  the dormouse fell asleep instantly  and neither of the others took the least notice of her going  though she looked back once or twice  half hoping that they would call after her  the last time she saw them  they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot   at any rate i  ll never go there again  said alice as she picked her way through the wood   it  s the stupidest tea  party i ever was at in all my life  just as she said this  she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it   that  s very curious  she thought   but everything  s curious today  i think i may as well go in at once  and in she went  once more she found herself in the long hall  and close to the little glass table   now  i  ll manage better this time  she said to herself  and began by taking the little golden key  and unlocking the door that led into the garden  then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom  she had kept a piece of it in her pocket  till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the little passage  and then  she found herself at last in the beautiful garden  among the bright flower  beds and the cool fountains  chapter viii  the queen  s croquet  ground a large rose  tree stood near the entrance of the garden  the roses growing on it were white  but there were three gardeners at it  busily painting them red  alice thought this a very curious thing  and she went nearer to watch them  and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say   look out now  five  don  t go splashing paint over me like that   i couldn  t help it  said five  in a sulky tone   seven jogged my elbow  on which seven looked up and said   that  s right  five  always lay the blame on others   you  d better not talk  said five   i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded   what for  said the one who had spoken first   that  s none of your business  two  said seven   yes  it is his business  said five   and i  ll tell him  it was for bringing the cook tulip  roots instead of onions  seven flung down his brush  and had just begun  well  of all the unjust things  when his eye chanced to fall upon alice  as she stood watching them  and he checked himself suddenly  the others looked round also  and all of them bowed low   would you tell me  said alice  a little timidly   why you are painting those roses  five and seven said nothing  but looked at two  two began in a low voice   why the fact is  you see  miss  this here ought to have been a red rose  tree  and we put a white one in by mistake  and if the queen was to find it out  we should all have our heads cut off  you know  so you see  miss  we  re doing our best  afore she comes  to  at this moment five  who had been anxiously looking across the garden  called out  the queen  the queen  and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces  there was a sound of many footsteps  and alice looked round  eager to see the queen  first came ten soldiers carrying clubs  these were all shaped like the three gardeners  oblong and flat  with their hands and feet at the corners  next the ten courtiers  these were ornamented all over with diamonds  and walked two and two  as the soldiers did  after these came the royal children  there were ten of them  and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand  in couples  they were all ornamented with hearts  next came the guests  mostly kings and queens  and among them alice recognised the white rabbit  it was talking in a hurried nervous manner  smiling at everything that was said  and went by without noticing her  then followed the knave of hearts  carrying the king  s crown on a crimson velvet cushion  and  last of all this grand procession  came the king and queen of hearts  alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners  but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions   and besides  what would be the use of a procession  thought she   if people had all to lie down upon their faces  so that they couldn  t see it  so she stood still where she was  and waited  when the procession came opposite to alice  they all stopped and looked at her  and the queen said severely  who is this  she said it to the knave of hearts  who only bowed and smiled in reply   idiot  said the queen  tossing her head impatiently  and  turning to alice  she went on   what  s your name  child   my name is alice  so please your majesty  said alice very politely  but she added  to herself   why  they  re only a pack of cards  after all  i needn  t be afraid of them   and who are these  said the queen  pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree  for  you see  as they were lying on their faces  and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack  she could not tell whether they were gardeners  or soldiers  or courtiers  or three of her own children   how should i know  said alice  surprised at her own courage   it  s no business of mine  the queen turned crimson with fury  and  after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast  screamed  off with her head  off   nonsense  said alice  very loudly and decidedly  and the queen was silent  the king laid his hand upon her arm  and timidly said  consider  my dear  she is only a child  the queen turned angrily away from him  and said to the knave  turn them over  the knave did so  very carefully  with one foot   get up  said the queen  in a shrill  loud voice  and the three gardeners instantly jumped up  and began bowing to the king  the queen  the royal children  and everybody else   leave off that  screamed the queen   you make me giddy  and then  turning to the rose  tree  she went on   what have you been doing here   may it please your majesty  said two  in a very humble tone  going down on one knee as he spoke   we were trying   i see  said the queen  who had meanwhile been examining the roses   off with their heads  and the procession moved on  three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners  who ran to alice for protection   you shan  t be beheaded  said alice  and she put them into a large flower  pot that stood near  the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two  looking for them  and then quietly marched off after the others   are their heads off  shouted the queen   their heads are gone  if it please your majesty  the soldiers shouted in reply   that  s right  shouted the queen   can you play croquet  the soldiers were silent  and looked at alice  as the question was evidently meant for her   yes  shouted alice   come on  then  roared the queen  and alice joined the procession  wondering very much what would happen next   it  s  it  s a very fine day  said a timid voice at her side  she was walking by the white rabbit  who was peeping anxiously into her face   very  said alice   where  s the duchess   hush  hush  said the rabbit in a low  hurried tone  he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke  and then raised himself upon tiptoe  put his mouth close to her ear  and whispered  she  s under sentence of execution   what for  said alice   did you say  what a pity  the rabbit asked   no  i didn  t  said alice   i don  t think it  s at all a pity  i said  what for   she boxed the queen  s ears  the rabbit began  alice gave a little scream of laughter   oh  hush  the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone   the queen will hear you  you see  she came rather late  and the queen said   get to your places  shouted the queen in a voice of thunder  and people began running about in all directions  tumbling up against each other  however  they got settled down in a minute or two  and the game began  alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquet  ground in her life  it was all ridges and furrows  the balls were live hedgehogs  the mallets live flamingoes  and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet  to make the arches  the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away  comfortably enough  under her arm  with its legs hanging down  but generally  just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out  and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head  it would twist itself round and look up in her face  with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing  and when she had got its head down  and was going to begin again  it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself  and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this  there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to  and  as the doubled  up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground  alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed  the players all played at once without waiting for turns  quarrelling all the while  and fighting for the hedgehogs  and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion  and went stamping about  and shouting  off with his head  or  off with her head  about once in a minute  alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure  she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen  but she knew that it might happen any minute   and then  thought she   what would become of me  they  re dreadfully fond of beheading people here  the great wonder is  that there  s any one left alive  she was looking about for some way of escape  and wondering whether she could get away without being seen  when she noticed a curious appearance in the air  it puzzled her very much at first  but  after watching it a minute or two  she made it out to be a grin  and she said to herself  it  s the cheshire cat  now i shall have somebody to talk to   how are you getting on  said the cat  as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with  alice waited till the eyes appeared  and then nodded   it  s no use speaking to it  she thought   till its ears have come  or at least one of them  in another minute the whole head appeared  and then alice put down her flamingo  and began an account of the game  feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her  the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight  and no more of it appeared   i don  t think they play at all fairly  alice began  in rather a complaining tone   and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can  t hear oneself speak  and they don  t seem to have any rules in particular  at least  if there are  nobody attends to them  and you  ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive  for instance  there  s the arch i  ve got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground  and i should have croqueted the queen  s hedgehog just now  only it ran away when it saw mine coming   how do you like the queen  said the cat in a low voice   not at all  said alice   she  s so extremely  just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her  listening  so she went on   likely to win  that it  s hardly worth while finishing the game  the queen smiled and passed on   who are you talking to  said the king  going up to alice  and looking at the cat  s head with great curiosity   it  s a friend of mine  a cheshire cat  said alice   allow me to introduce it   i don  t like the look of it at all  said the king   however  it may kiss my hand if it likes   i  d rather not  the cat remarked   don  t be impertinent  said the king   and don  t look at me like that  he got behind alice as he spoke   a cat may look at a king  said alice   i  ve read that in some book  but i don  t remember where   well  it must be removed  said the king very decidedly  and he called the queen  who was passing at the moment   my dear  i wish you would have this cat removed  the queen had only one way of settling all difficulties  great or small   off with his head  she said  without even looking round   i  ll fetch the executioner myself  said the king eagerly  and he hurried off  alice thought she might as well go back  and see how the game was going on  as she heard the queen  s voice in the distance  screaming with passion  she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns  and she did not like the look of things at all  as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not  so she went in search of her hedgehog  the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog  which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other  the only difficulty was  that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden  where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree  by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back  the fight was over  and both the hedgehogs were out of sight   but it doesn  t matter much  thought alice   as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground  so she tucked it away under her arm  that it might not escape again  and went back for a little more conversation with her friend  when she got back to the cheshire cat  she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute going on between the executioner  the king  and the queen  who were all talking at once  while all the rest were quite silent  and looked very uncomfortable  the moment alice appeared  she was appealed to by all three to settle the question  and they repeated their arguments to her  though  as they all spoke at once  she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said  the executioner  s argument was  that you couldn  t cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had never had to do such a thing before  and he wasn  t going to begin at his time of life  the king  s argument was  that anything that had a head could be beheaded  and that you weren  t to talk nonsense  the queen  s argument was  that if something wasn  t done about it in less than no time she  d have everybody executed  all round   it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious  alice could think of nothing else to say but  it belongs to the duchess  you  d better ask her about it   she  s in prison  the queen said to the executioner   fetch her here  and the executioner went off like an arrow  the cat  s head began fading away the moment he was gone  and  by the time he had come back with the duchess  it had entirely disappeared  so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it  while the rest of the party went back to the game  chapter ix  the mock turtle  s story  you can  t think how glad i am to see you again  you dear old thing  said the duchess  as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice  s  and they walked off together  alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper  and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchen   when i  m a duchess  she said to herself   not in a very hopeful tone though   i won  t have any pepper in my kitchen at all  soup does very well without  maybe it  s always pepper that makes people hot  tempered  she went on  very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule   and vinegar that makes them sour  and camomile that makes them bitter  and  and barley  sugar and such things that make children sweet  tempered  i only wish people knew that  then they wouldn  t be so stingy about it  you know  she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time  and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear   you  re thinking about something  my dear  and that makes you forget to talk  i can  t tell you just now what the moral of that is  but i shall remember it in a bit   perhaps it hasn  t one  alice ventured to remark   tut  tut  child  said the duchess   everything  s got a moral  if only you can find it  and she squeezed herself up closer to alice  s side as she spoke  alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first  because the duchess was very ugly  and secondly  because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alice  s shoulder  and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin  however  she did not like to be rude  so she bore it as well as she could   the game  s going on rather better now  she said  by way of keeping up the conversation a little   tis so  said the duchess   and the moral of that is  oh   tis love   tis love  that makes the world go round   somebody said  alice whispered   that it  s done by everybody minding their own business   ah  well  it means much the same thing  said the duchess  digging her sharp little chin into alice  s shoulder as she added   and the moral of that is  take care of the sense  and the sounds will take care of themselves   how fond she is of finding morals in things  alice thought to herself   i dare say you  re wondering why i don  t put my arm round your waist  the duchess said after a pause   the reason is  that i  m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo  shall i try the experiment   he might bite  alice cautiously replied  not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried   very true  said the duchess   flamingoes and mustard both bite  and the moral of that is  birds of a feather flock together   only mustard isn  t a bird  alice remarked   right  as usual  said the duchess   what a clear way you have of putting things   it  s a mineral  i think  said alice   of course it is  said the duchess  who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said   there  s a large mustard  mine near here  and the moral of that is  the more there is of mine  the less there is of yours   oh  i know  exclaimed alice  who had not attended to this last remark   it  s a vegetable  it doesn  t look like one  but it is   i quite agree with you  said the duchess   and the moral of that is  be what you would seem to be  or if you  d like it put more simply  never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise   i think i should understand that better  alice said very politely   if i had it written down  but i can  t quite follow it as you say it   that  s nothing to what i could say if i chose  the duchess replied  in a pleased tone   pray don  t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that  said alice   oh  don  t talk about trouble  said the duchess   i make you a present of everything i  ve said as yet   a cheap sort of present  thought alice   i  m glad they don  t give birthday presents like that  but she did not venture to say it out loud   thinking again  the duchess asked  with another dig of her sharp little chin   i  ve a right to think  said alice sharply  for she was beginning to feel a little worried   just about as much right  said the duchess   as pigs have to fly  and the m  but here  to alice  s great surprise  the duchess  s voice died away  even in the middle of her favourite word  moral  and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble  alice looked up  and there stood the queen in front of them  with her arms folded  frowning like a thunderstorm   a fine day  your majesty  the duchess began in a low  weak voice   now  i give you fair warning  shouted the queen  stamping on the ground as she spoke   either you or your head must be off  and that in about half no time  take your choice  the duchess took her choice  and was gone in a moment   let  s go on with the game  the queen said to alice  and alice was too much frightened to say a word  but slowly followed her back to the croquet  ground  the other guests had taken advantage of the queen  s absence  and were resting in the shade  however  the moment they saw her  they hurried back to the game  the queen merely remarking that a moment  s delay would cost them their lives  all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players  and shouting  off with his head  or  off with her head  those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers  who of course had to leave off being arches to do this  so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left  and all the players  except the king  the queen  and alice  were in custody and under sentence of execution  then the queen left off  quite out of breath  and said to alice   have you seen the mock turtle yet   no  said alice   i don  t even know what a mock turtle is   it  s the thing mock turtle soup is made from  said the queen   i never saw one  or heard of one  said alice   come on  then  said the queen   and he shall tell you his history  as they walked off together  alice heard the king say in a low voice  to the company generally   you are all pardoned   come  that  s a good thing  she said to herself  for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered  they very soon came upon a gryphon  lying fast asleep in the sun   if you don  t know what a gryphon is  look at the picture   up  lazy thing  said the queen   and take this young lady to see the mock turtle  and to hear his history  i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered  and she walked off  leaving alice alone with the gryphon  alice did not quite like the look of the creature  but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen  so she waited  the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the queen till she was out of sight  then it chuckled   what fun  said the gryphon  half to itself  half to alice   what is the fun  said alice   why  she  said the gryphon   it  s all her fancy  that  they never executes nobody  you know  come on   everybody says  come on  here  thought alice  as she went slowly after it   i never was so ordered about in all my life  never  they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance  sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock  and  as they came nearer  alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break  she pitied him deeply   what is his sorrow  she asked the gryphon  and the gryphon answered  very nearly in the same words as before   it  s all his fancy  that  he hasn  t got no sorrow  you know  come on  so they went up to the mock turtle  who looked at them with large eyes full of tears  but said nothing   this here young lady  said the gryphon   she wants for to know your history  she do   i  ll tell it her  said the mock turtle in a deep  hollow tone   sit down  both of you  and don  t speak a word till i  ve finished  so they sat down  and nobody spoke for some minutes  alice thought to herself   i don  t see how he can even finish  if he doesn  t begin  but she waited patiently   once  said the mock turtle at last  with a deep sigh   i was a real turtle  these words were followed by a very long silence  broken only by an occasional exclamation of  hjckrrh  from the gryphon  and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle  alice was very nearly getting up and saying   thank you  sir  for your interesting story  but she could not help thinking there must be more to come  so she sat still and said nothing   when we were little  the mock turtle went on at last  more calmly  though still sobbing a little now and then   we went to school in the sea  the master was an old turtle  we used to call him tortoise   why did you call him tortoise  if he wasn  t one  alice asked   we called him tortoise because he taught us  said the mock turtle angrily   really you are very dull   you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question  added the gryphon  and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice  who felt ready to sink into the earth  at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle   drive on  old fellow  don  t be all day about it  and he went on in these words   yes  we went to school in the sea  though you mayn  t believe it   i never said i didn  t  interrupted alice   you did  said the mock turtle   hold your tongue  added the gryphon  before alice could speak again  the mock turtle went on   we had the best of educations  in fact  we went to school every day   i  ve been to a day  school  too  said alice   you needn  t be so proud as all that   with extras  asked the mock turtle a little anxiously   yes  said alice   we learned french and music   and washing  said the mock turtle   certainly not  said alice indignantly   ah  then yours wasn  t a really good school  said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief   now at ours they had at the end of the bill   french  music  and washing  extra   you couldn  t have wanted it much  said alice   living at the bottom of the sea   i couldn  t afford to learn it  said the mock turtle with a sigh   i only took the regular course   what was that  inquired alice   reeling and writhing  of course  to begin with  the mock turtle replied   and then the different branches of arithmetic  ambition  distraction  uglification  and derision   i never heard of  uglification  alice ventured to say   what is it  the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise   what  never heard of uglifying  it exclaimed   you know what to beautify is  i suppose   yes  said alice doubtfully   it means  to  make  anything  prettier   well  then  the gryphon went on   if you don  t know what to uglify is  you are a simpleton  alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it  so she turned to the mock turtle  and said  what else had you to learn   well  there was mystery  the mock turtle replied  counting off the subjects on his flappers   mystery  ancient and modern  with seaography  then drawling  the drawling  master was an old conger  eel  that used to come once a week  he taught us drawling  stretching  and fainting in coils   what was that like  said alice   well  i can  t show it you myself  the mock turtle said   i  m too stiff  and the gryphon never learnt it   hadn  t time  said the gryphon   i went to the classics master  though  he was an old crab  he was   i never went to him  the mock turtle said with a sigh   he taught laughing and grief  they used to say   so he did  so he did  said the gryphon  sighing in his turn  and both creatures hid their faces in their paws   and how many hours a day did you do lessons  said alice  in a hurry to change the subject   ten hours the first day  said the mock turtle   nine the next  and so on   what a curious plan  exclaimed alice   that  s the reason they  re called lessons  the gryphon remarked   because they lessen from day to day  this was quite a new idea to alice  and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark   then the eleventh day must have been a holiday   of course it was  said the mock turtle   and how did you manage on the twelfth  alice went on eagerly   that  s enough about lessons  the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone   tell her something about the games now  chapter x  the lobster quadrille the mock turtle sighed deeply  and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes  he looked at alice  and tried to speak  but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice   same as if he had a bone in his throat  said the gryphon  and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back  at last the mock turtle recovered his voice  and  with tears running down his cheeks  he went on again   you may not have lived much under the sea   i haven  t  said alice  and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster   alice began to say  i once tasted  but checked herself hastily  and said  no  never   so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is   no  indeed  said alice   what sort of a dance is it   why  said the gryphon   you first form into a line along the sea  shore   two lines  cried the mock turtle   seals  turtles  salmon  and so on  then  when you  ve cleared all the jelly  fish out of the way   that generally takes some time  interrupted the gryphon   you advance twice   each with a lobster as a partner  cried the gryphon   of course  the mock turtle said   advance twice  set to partners   change lobsters  and retire in same order  continued the gryphon   then  you know  the mock turtle went on   you throw the   the lobsters  shouted the gryphon  with a bound into the air   as far out to sea as you can   swim after them  screamed the gryphon   turn a somersault in the sea  cried the mock turtle  capering wildly about   change lobsters again  yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice   back to land again  and that  s all the first figure  said the mock turtle  suddenly dropping his voice  and the two creatures  who had been jumping about like mad things all this time  sat down again very sadly and quietly  and looked at alice   it must be a very pretty dance  said alice timidly   would you like to see a little of it  said the mock turtle   very much indeed  said alice   come  let  s try the first figure  said the mock turtle to the gryphon   we can do without lobsters  you know  which shall sing   oh  you sing  said the gryphon   i  ve forgotten the words  so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice  every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close  and waving their forepaws to mark the time  while the mock turtle sang this  very slowly and sadly   will you walk a little faster  said a whiting to a snail   there  s a porpoise close behind us  and he  s treading on my tail  see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance  they are waiting on the shingle  will you come and join the dance  will you  won  t you  will you  won  t you  will you join the dance  will you  won  t you  will you  won  t you  won  t you join the dance   you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us  with the lobsters  out to sea  but the snail replied  too far  too far  and gave a look askance  said he thanked the whiting kindly  but he would not join the dance  would not  could not  would not  could not  would not join the dance  would not  could not  would not  could not  could not join the dance   what matters it how far we go  his scaly friend replied   there is another shore  you know  upon the other side  the further off from england the nearer is to france  then turn not pale  beloved snail  but come and join the dance  will you  won  t you  will you  won  t you  will you join the dance  will you  won  t you  will you  won  t you  won  t you join the dance   thank you  it  s a very interesting dance to watch  said alice  feeling very glad that it was over at last   and i do so like that curious song about the whiting   oh  as to the whiting  said the mock turtle   they  you  ve seen them  of course   yes  said alice   i  ve often seen them at dinn  she checked herself hastily   i don  t know where dinn may be  said the mock turtle   but if you  ve seen them so often  of course you know what they  re like   i believe so  alice replied thoughtfully   they have their tails in their mouths  and they  re all over crumbs   you  re wrong about the crumbs  said the mock turtle   crumbs would all wash off in the sea  but they have their tails in their mouths  and the reason is  here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes  tell her about the reason and all that  he said to the gryphon   the reason is  said the gryphon   that they would go with the lobsters to the dance  so they got thrown out to sea  so they had to fall a long way  so they got their tails fast in their mouths  so they couldn  t get them out again  that  s all   thank you  said alice   it  s very interesting  i never knew so much about a whiting before   i can tell you more than that  if you like  said the gryphon   do you know why it  s called a whiting   i never thought about it  said alice   why   it does the boots and shoes  the gryphon replied very solemnly  alice was thoroughly puzzled   does the boots and shoes  she repeated in a wondering tone   why  what are your shoes done with  said the gryphon   i mean  what makes them so shiny  alice looked down at them  and considered a little before she gave her answer   they  re done with blacking  i believe   boots and shoes under the sea  the gryphon went on in a deep voice   are done with a whiting  now you know   and what are they made of  alice asked in a tone of great curiosity   soles and eels  of course  the gryphon replied rather impatiently   any shrimp could have told you that   if i  d been the whiting  said alice  whose thoughts were still running on the song   i  d have said to the porpoise   keep back  please  we don  t want you with us   they were obliged to have him with them  the mock turtle said   no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise   wouldn  t it really  said alice in a tone of great surprise   of course not  said the mock turtle   why  if a fish came to me  and told me he was going a journey  i should say  with what porpoise   don  t you mean  purpose  said alice   i mean what i say  the mock turtle replied in an offended tone  and the gryphon added  come  let  s hear some of your adventures   i could tell you my adventures  beginning from this morning  said alice a little timidly   but it  s no use going back to yesterday  because i was a different person then   explain all that  said the mock turtle   no  no  the adventures first  said the gryphon in an impatient tone   explanations take such a dreadful time  so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit  she was a little nervous about it just at first  the two creatures got so close to her  one on each side  and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide  but she gained courage as she went on  her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating  you are old  father william  to the caterpillar  and the words all coming different  and then the mock turtle drew a long breath  and said  that  s very curious   it  s all about as curious as it can be  said the gryphon   it all came different  the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully   i should like to hear her try and repeat something now  tell her to begin  he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice   stand up and repeat  tis the voice of the sluggard  said the gryphon   how the creatures order one about  and make one repeat lessons  thought alice   i might as well be at school at once  however  she got up  and began to repeat it  but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille  that she hardly knew what she was saying  and the words came very queer indeed   tis the voice of the lobster  i heard him declare   you have baked me too brown  i must sugar my hair  as a duck with its eyelids  so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons  and turns out his toes   later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry  he is gay as a lark  and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark  but  when the tide rises and sharks are around  his voice has a timid and tremulous sound   that  s different from what i used to say when i was a child  said the gryphon   well  i never heard it before  said the mock turtle   but it sounds uncommon nonsense  alice said nothing  she had sat down with her face in her hands  wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again   i should like to have it explained  said the mock turtle   she can  t explain it  said the gryphon hastily   go on with the next verse   but about his toes  the mock turtle persisted   how could he turn them out with his nose  you know   it  s the first position in dancing  alice said  but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing  and longed to change the subject   go on with the next verse  the gryphon repeated impatiently   it begins  i passed by his garden  alice did not dare to disobey  though she felt sure it would all come wrong  and she went on in a trembling voice   i passed by his garden  and marked  with one eye  how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie   later editions continued as follows the panther took pie  crust  and gravy  and meat  while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat  when the pie was all finished  the owl  as a boon  was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon  while the panther received knife and fork with a growl  and concluded the banquet   what is the use of repeating all that stuff  the mock turtle interrupted   if you don  t explain it as you go on  it  s by far the most confusing thing i ever heard   yes  i think you  d better leave off  said the gryphon  and alice was only too glad to do so   shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille  the gryphon went on   or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song   oh  a song  please  if the mock turtle would be so kind  alice replied  so eagerly that the gryphon said  in a rather offended tone   hm  no accounting for tastes  sing her  turtle soup  will you  old fellow  the mock turtle sighed deeply  and began  in a voice sometimes choked with sobs  to sing this   beautiful soup  so rich and green  waiting in a hot tureen  who for such dainties would not stoop  soup of the evening  beautiful soup  soup of the evening  beautiful soup  beau  ootiful soo  oop  beau  ootiful soo  oop  soo  oop of the e  e  evening  beautiful  beautiful soup   beautiful soup  who cares for fish  game  or any other dish  who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of beautiful soup  pennyworth only of beautiful soup  beau  ootiful soo  oop  beau  ootiful soo  oop  soo  oop of the e  e  evening  beautiful  beauti  ful soup   chorus again  cried the gryphon  and the mock turtle had just begun to repeat it  when a cry of  the trial  s beginning  was heard in the distance   come on  cried the gryphon  and  taking alice by the hand  it hurried off  without waiting for the end of the song   what trial is it  alice panted as she ran  but the gryphon only answered  come on  and ran the faster  while more and more faintly came  carried on the breeze that followed them  the melancholy words   soo  oop of the e  e  evening  beautiful  beautiful soup  chapter xi  who stole the tarts  the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived  with a great crowd assembled about them  all sorts of little birds and beasts  as well as the whole pack of cards  the knave was standing before them  in chains  with a soldier on each side to guard him  and near the king was the white rabbit  with a trumpet in one hand  and a scroll of parchment in the other  in the very middle of the court was a table  with a large dish of tarts upon it  they looked so good  that it made alice quite hungry to look at them  i wish they  d get the trial done  she thought   and hand round the refreshments  but there seemed to be no chance of this  so she began looking at everything about her  to pass away the time  alice had never been in a court of justice before  but she had read about them in books  and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there   that  s the judge  she said to herself   because of his great wig  the judge  by the way  was the king  and as he wore his crown over the wig   look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it  he did not look at all comfortable  and it was certainly not becoming   and that  s the jury  box  thought alice   and those twelve creatures   she was obliged to say  creatures  you see  because some of them were animals  and some were birds   i suppose they are the jurors  she said this last word two or three times over to herself  being rather proud of it  for she thought  and rightly too  that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all  however   jury  men  would have done just as well  the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates   what are they doing  alice whispered to the gryphon   they can  t have anything to put down yet  before the trial  s begun   they  re putting down their names  the gryphon whispered in reply   for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial   stupid things  alice began in a loud  indignant voice  but she stopped hastily  for the white rabbit cried out   silence in the court  and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round  to make out who was talking  alice could see  as well as if she were looking over their shoulders  that all the jurors were writing down  stupid things  on their slates  and she could even make out that one of them didn  t know how to spell  stupid  and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him   a nice muddle their slates  ll be in before the trial  s over  thought alice  one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked  this of course  alice could not stand  and she went round the court and got behind him  and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away  she did it so quickly that the poor little juror  it was bill  the lizard  could not make out at all what had become of it  so  after hunting all about for it  he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day  and this was of very little use  as it left no mark on the slate   herald  read the accusation  said the king  on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet  and then unrolled the parchment scroll  and read as follows   the queen of hearts  she made some tarts  all on a summer day  the knave of hearts  he stole those tarts  and took them quite away   consider your verdict  the king said to the jury   not yet  not yet  the rabbit hastily interrupted   there  s a great deal to come before that   call the first witness  said the king  and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet  and called out   first witness  the first witness was the hatter  he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread  and  butter in the other   i beg pardon  your majesty  he began   for bringing these in  but i hadn  t quite finished my tea when i was sent for   you ought to have finished  said the king   when did you begin  the hatter looked at the march hare  who had followed him into the court  arm  in  arm with the dormouse   fourteenth of march  i think it was  he said   fifteenth  said the march hare   sixteenth  added the dormouse   write that down  the king said to the jury  and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates  and then added them up  and reduced the answer to shillings and pence   take off your hat  the king said to the hatter   it isn  t mine  said the hatter   stolen  the king exclaimed  turning to the jury  who instantly made a memorandum of the fact   i keep them to sell  the hatter added as an explanation   i  ve none of my own  i  m a hatter  here the queen put on her spectacles  and began staring at the hatter  who turned pale and fidgeted   give your evidence  said the king   and don  t be nervous  or i  ll have you executed on the spot  this did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept shifting from one foot to the other  looking uneasily at the queen  and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the bread  and  butter  just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation  which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was beginning to grow larger again  and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court  but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her   i wish you wouldn  t squeeze so  said the dormouse  who was sitting next to her   i can hardly breathe   i can  t help it  said alice very meekly   i  m growing   you  ve no right to grow here  said the dormouse   don  t talk nonsense  said alice more boldly   you know you  re growing too   yes  but i grow at a reasonable pace  said the dormouse   not in that ridiculous fashion  and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court  all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter  and  just as the dormouse crossed the court  she said to one of the officers of the court   bring me the list of the singers in the last concert  on which the wretched hatter trembled so  that he shook both his shoes off   give your evidence  the king repeated angrily   or i  ll have you executed  whether you  re nervous or not   i  m a poor man  your majesty  the hatter began  in a trembling voice   and i hadn  t begun my tea  not above a week or so  and what with the bread  and  butter getting so thin  and the twinkling of the tea   the twinkling of the what  said the king   it began with the tea  the hatter replied   of course twinkling begins with a t  said the king sharply   do you take me for a dunce  go on   i  m a poor man  the hatter went on   and most things twinkled after that  only the march hare said   i didn  t  the march hare interrupted in a great hurry   you did  said the hatter   i deny it  said the march hare   he denies it  said the king   leave out that part   well  at any rate  the dormouse said  the hatter went on  looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too  but the dormouse denied nothing  being fast asleep   after that  continued the hatter   i cut some more bread  and  butter   but what did the dormouse say  one of the jury asked   that i can  t remember  said the hatter   you must remember  remarked the king   or i  ll have you executed  the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread  and  butter  and went down on one knee   i  m a poor man  your majesty  he began   you  re a very poor speaker  said the king  here one of the guinea  pigs cheered  and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court   as that is rather a hard word  i will just explain to you how it was done  they had a large canvas bag  which tied up at the mouth with strings  into this they slipped the guinea  pig  head first  and then sat upon it   i  m glad i  ve seen that done  thought alice   i  ve so often read in the newspapers  at the end of trials   there was some attempts at applause  which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court  and i never understood what it meant till now   if that  s all you know about it  you may stand down  continued the king   i can  t go no lower  said the hatter   i  m on the floor  as it is   then you may sit down  the king replied  here the other guinea  pig cheered  and was suppressed   come  that finished the guinea  pigs  thought alice   now we shall get on better   i  d rather finish my tea  said the hatter  with an anxious look at the queen  who was reading the list of singers   you may go  said the king  and the hatter hurriedly left the court  without even waiting to put his shoes on   and just take his head off outside  the queen added to one of the officers  but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door   call the next witness  said the king  the next witness was the duchess  s cook  she carried the pepper  box in her hand  and alice guessed who it was  even before she got into the court  by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once   give your evidence  said the king   shan  t  said the cook  the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit  who said in a low voice   your majesty must cross  examine this witness   well  if i must  i must  the king said  with a melancholy air  and  after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight  he said in a deep voice   what are tarts made of   pepper  mostly  said the cook   treacle  said a sleepy voice behind her   collar that dormouse  the queen shrieked out   behead that dormouse  turn that dormouse out of court  suppress him  pinch him  off with his whiskers  for some minutes the whole court was in confusion  getting the dormouse turned out  and  by the time they had settled down again  the cook had disappeared   never mind  said the king  with an air of great relief   call the next witness  and he added in an undertone to the queen   really  my dear  you must cross  examine the next witness  it quite makes my forehead ache  alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list  feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like   for they haven  t got much evidence yet  she said to herself  imagine her surprise  when the white rabbit read out  at the top of his shrill little voice  the name  alice  chapter xii alice  s evidence  here  cried alice  quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes  and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury  box with the edge of her skirt  upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below  and there they lay sprawling about  reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before   oh  i beg your pardon  she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay  and began picking them up again as quickly as she could  for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head  and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury  box  or they would die   the trial cannot proceed  said the king in a very grave voice   until all the jurymen are back in their proper places  all  he repeated with great emphasis  looking hard at alice as he said do  alice looked at the jury  box  and saw that  in her haste  she had put the lizard in head downwards  and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way  being quite unable to move  she soon got it out again  and put it right   not that it signifies much  she said to herself   i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other  as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset  and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them  they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident  all except the lizard  who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open  gazing up into the roof of the court   what do you know about this business  the king said to alice   nothing  said alice   nothing whatever  persisted the king   nothing whatever  said alice   that  s very important  the king said  turning to the jury  they were just beginning to write this down on their slates  when the white rabbit interrupted   unimportant  your majesty means  of course  he said in a very respectful tone  but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke   unimportant  of course  i meant  the king hastily said  and went on to himself in an undertone   important  unimportant  unimportant  important  as if he were trying which word sounded best  some of the jury wrote it down  important  and some  unimportant  alice could see this  as she was near enough to look over their slates   but it doesn  t matter a bit  she thought to herself  at this moment the king  who had been for some time busily writing in his note  book  cackled out  silence  and read out from his book   rule forty  two  all persons more than a mile high to leave the court  everybody looked at alice   i  m not a mile high  said alice   you are  said the king   nearly two miles high  added the queen   well  i shan  t go  at any rate  said alice   besides  that  s not a regular rule  you invented it just now   it  s the oldest rule in the book  said the king   then it ought to be number one  said alice  the king turned pale  and shut his note  book hastily   consider your verdict  he said to the jury  in a low  trembling voice   there  s more evidence to come yet  please your majesty  said the white rabbit  jumping up in a great hurry   this paper has just been picked up   what  s in it  said the queen   i haven  t opened it yet  said the white rabbit   but it seems to be a letter  written by the prisoner to  to somebody   it must have been that  said the king   unless it was written to nobody  which isn  t usual  you know   who is it directed to  said one of the jurymen   it isn  t directed at all  said the white rabbit   in fact  there  s nothing written on the outside  he unfolded the paper as he spoke  and added  it isn  t a letter  after all  it  s a set of verses   are they in the prisoner  s handwriting  asked another of the jurymen   no  they  re not  said the white rabbit   and that  s the queerest thing about it   the jury all looked puzzled   he must have imitated somebody else  s hand  said the king   the jury all brightened up again   please your majesty  said the knave   i didn  t write it  and they can  t prove i did  there  s no name signed at the end   if you didn  t sign it  said the king   that only makes the matter worse  you must have meant some mischief  or else you  d have signed your name like an honest man  there was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the first really clever thing the king had said that day   that proves his guilt  said the queen   it proves nothing of the sort  said alice   why  you don  t even know what they  re about   read them  said the king  the white rabbit put on his spectacles   where shall i begin  please your majesty  he asked   begin at the beginning  the king said gravely   and go on till you come to the end  then stop  these were the verses the white rabbit read   they told me you had been to her  and mentioned me to him  she gave me a good character  but said i could not swim  he sent them word i had not gone  we know it to be true  if she should push the matter on  what would become of you  i gave her one  they gave him two  you gave us three or more  they all returned from him to you  though they were mine before  if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair  he trusts to you to set them free  exactly as we were  my notion was that you had been  before she had this fit  an obstacle that came between him  and ourselves  and it  don  t let him know she liked them best  for this must ever be a secret  kept from all the rest  between yourself and me   that  s the most important piece of evidence we  ve heard yet  said the king  rubbing his hands   so now let the jury   if any one of them can explain it  said alice   she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn  t a bit afraid of interrupting him   i  ll give him sixpence  i don  t believe there  s an atom of meaning in it  the jury all wrote down on their slates   she doesn  t believe there  s an atom of meaning in it  but none of them attempted to explain the paper   if there  s no meaning in it  said the king   that saves a world of trouble  you know  as we needn  t try to find any  and yet i don  t know  he went on  spreading out the verses on his knee  and looking at them with one eye   i seem to see some meaning in them  after all   said i could not swim  you can  t swim  can you  he added  turning to the knave  the knave shook his head sadly   do i look like it  he said   which he certainly did not  being made entirely of cardboard   all right  so far  said the king  and he went on muttering over the verses to himself   we know it to be true  that  s the jury  of course  i gave her one  they gave him two  why  that must be what he did with the tarts  you know   but  it goes on  they all returned from him to you  said alice   why  there they are  said the king triumphantly  pointing to the tarts on the table   nothing can be clearer than that  then again  before she had this fit  you never had fits  my dear  i think  he said to the queen   never  said the queen furiously  throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke   the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger  as he found it made no mark  but he now hastily began again  using the ink  that was trickling down his face  as long as it lasted   then the words don  t fit you  said the king  looking round the court with a smile  there was a dead silence   it  s a pun  the king added in an offended tone  and everybody laughed   let the jury consider their verdict  the king said  for about the twentieth time that day   no  no  said the queen   sentence first  verdict afterwards   stuff and nonsense  said alice loudly   the idea of having the sentence first   hold your tongue  said the queen  turning purple   i won  t  said alice   off with her head  the queen shouted at the top of her voice  nobody moved   who cares for you  said alice   she had grown to her full size by this time   you  re nothing but a pack of cards  at this the whole pack rose up into the air  and came flying down upon her  she gave a little scream  half of fright and half of anger  and tried to beat them off  and found herself lying on the bank  with her head in the lap of her sister  who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face   wake up  alice dear  said her sister   why  what a long sleep you  ve had   oh  i  ve had such a curious dream  said alice  and she told her sister  as well as she could remember them  all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about  and when she had finished  her sister kissed her  and said   it was a curious dream  dear  certainly  but now run in to your tea  it  s getting late  so alice got up and ran off  thinking while she ran  as well she might  what a wonderful dream it had been  but her sister sat still just as she left her  leaning her head on her hand  watching the setting sun  and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures  till she too began dreaming after a fashion  and this was her dream  first  she dreamed of little alice herself  and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee  and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers  she could hear the very tones of her voice  and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyes  and still as she listened  or seemed to listen  the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sister  s dream  the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by  the frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool  she could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their never  ending meal  and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution  once more the pig  baby was sneezing on the duchess  s knee  while plates and dishes crashed around it  once more the shriek of the gryphon  the squeaking of the lizard  s slate  pencil  and the choking of the suppressed guinea  pigs  filled the air  mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle  so she sat on  with closed eyes  and half believed herself in wonderland  though she knew she had but to open them again  and all would change to dull reality  the grass would be only rustling in the wind  and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds  the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep  bells  and the queen  s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy  and the sneeze of the baby  the shriek of the gryphon  and all the other queer noises  would change  she knew  to the confused clamour of the busy farm  yard  while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle  s heavy sobs  lastly  she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would  in the after  time  be herself a grown woman  and how she would keep  through all her riper years  the simple and loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about her other little children  and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale  perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows  and find a pleasure in all their simple joys  remembering her own child  life  and the happy summer days  '"
